<p>The United States controls the world, but the Jews control the United States?</p>
<p>Why do people say Israel is the father of the United States?</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<h2 id="Part-One"><a href="#Part-One" class="headerlink" title="Part One"></a>Part One</h2><p>During my teenage years, the Jewish people, located thousands of miles away, always appeared to me in the media with an elite disposition. They were often portrayed as a highly educated, hardworking, book-loving, financially savvy community. Many scientists, thinkers, artists, and entrepreneurs were of Jewish descent, including renowned figures such as Einstein, Picasso, Morgan, Rockefeller, Greenspan, Soros, Bloomberg, Zuckerberg, Reuters, Karajan, Freud, Kissinger, and many more.</p>
<p>Today, the Jewish population stands at around 16 million, making up only 0.3% of the global population, yet they have received 22% of the Nobel Prizes, which is an astonishing achievement.</p>
<p>Comparatively, consider the Romani people (with a population of 12 million) and the Kurds (with over 30 million), both of which have a similarly sized population. These two groups, however, have not achieved the same success as the Jewish community. Romani people are often associated with activities such as petty theft, dancing, and fortune-telling, and rarely engage in formal education. Kurds, on the other hand, have faced numerous conflicts and oppressions in the Middle East, and they continue to struggle for survival.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whenever the media mentions the Jewish community, they often emphasize their history of suffering and their appreciation for help. During World War II, six million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany, and Hollywood repeatedly reminds us of the immense suffering of the Jewish people through films like “Schindler’s List” and “The Pianist.” Chinese magazines in the past also focused on stories of Jewish people saved in Shanghai, highlighting the quiet reciprocation of the Jewish community.</p>
<p>This portrayal of Jewish people has created an image of resilience mixed with sorrow. In China, Jewish people were seen as saviors ready to rescue humanity, characterized by qualities such as determination, sanctity, wisdom, wealth, kindness, and resilience.</p>
<p>Chinese bookstores have been eager to promote this concept. Books like “The Jewish Wealth Code” and “Jewish Parenting Bedside Guide” can be found everywhere. Perhaps influenced by these books and magazines, I have heard numerous teachers passionately describe in front of the class how Jewish people are a suffering yet upwardly mobile, resilient ethnic group.</p>
<p>Despite having minimal interactions with Jewish individuals, I did not hold any strong opinions about them. I was content with the idea that the Jewish people were seen as an inspirational group for the public.</p>
<p>However, as I began to delve deeper into the history of various countries in recent years, Jewish names kept emerging. Initially, a few times did not bother me, but when this frequency increased, I was compelled to classify and analyze their behavior. Gradually, my impression of Jewish people began to shift.</p>
<p>Before sharing my viewpoint, I want to clarify my reasoning.</p>
<p>First, I am against the oversimplification and generalization of any ethnic group. I oppose extreme views and believe that issues should not be overly polarized, as extreme perspectives can lead to self-delusion.</p>
<p>Second, I have no personal grievances with Jewish people. My understanding of this community is based on their historical actions. My analysis is solely based on facts and interests.</p>
<p>I have contemplated the potential consequences of discussing Jewish people. I acknowledge that if I express opinions that are unfavorable to Jewish people, <strong>considering their current influence in the world media and financial sectors, I may face difficulties. However, in order to convey the truth, I have decided to continue writing.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Part-Two"><a href="#Part-Two" class="headerlink" title="Part Two"></a>Part Two</h2><p>My first point is that <strong>today’s Jewish people no longer resemble an ethnic group linked by bloodline and Judaism but rather appear to be an elite class controlling global finance and media.</strong></p>
<p>This is particularly true for American Jews.</p>
<p>Jews originated in Western Asia, migrated to Europe, and then dispersed worldwide. Their physical appearance is often similar to that of Arab people, with a typical look characterized by a lack of tall stature, dark hair, dark eyes, a prominent nose with a slight curve, and thicker nostrils. </p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/10/29/R1qy8VpUI4sYMml.jpg" alt="jewish-profile"></p>
<p>This appearance, particularly the nose, was used by the Nazis for identifying Jews. Jewish noses are relatively larger, with a slightly arched bridge and thicker nostrils, and they tend to droop at the tip, which the Nazis referred to as the “Jewish nose.” Anyone with a shorter stature and this kind of nose was easily identified as Jewish.</p>
<p>Chinese residents living in Europe have summarized the distinguishing characteristics of various ethnicities, stating that individuals with black hair and dark eyes who dress well are Italians, people with light hair, a serious demeanor, and no nonsense are Germans, people with dark hair, brown eyes, large noses, and a carefree attitude who like to flirt with girls are French, people with a proud expression are typically British, and those with a shorter stature, a larger nose, and an Eastern vibe are Jewish.</p>
<p>However, if you compare the photos of some of the Jewish individuals controlling the United States today, you’ll find that aside from figures like Mark Zuckerberg, many no longer have the typical Jewish appearance. Some of them have the common facial features of Caucasian Americans, like Warren Buffett, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates, and others. Moreover, this facial type is prevalent in the United States, with some individuals having golden hair and taller statures, while the standard Jewish appearance is less common.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/10/29/NXrpPBzU3VnDYvo.jpg" alt="Buffett"></p>
<p>This demonstrates that the meaning of the term “Jewish people” is evolving in today’s context. </p>
<p><strong>Instead of categorizing individuals solely based on historical data, we should assess them based on the interest groups they are associated with to truly understand the situation.</strong></p>
<p>We all know that Ivanka, the daughter of former U.S. President Donald Trump, married Jared Kushner, who is Jewish. Similarly, the current President Joe Biden’s wife and both his daughters-in-law are Jewish.</p>
<p>Both Trump and Biden have European ancestry, with numerous intermarriages between Jewish individuals, causing a significant change in the Jewish bloodline. </p>
<p>It’s not just white elites like Trump and Biden who have been infiltrated by Jewish individuals; even the previous President, Barack Obama, from the elite African American community, had Jewish connections.</p>
<p>Obama’s mother was Jewish, and when she lived in Hawaii, Obama’s father, who was from Kenya, studied economics at the University of Hawaii. After they met, they quickly married, and she was only 18 years old at the time. They divorced when Obama was two years old, and his father left. Obama’s mother was young and beautiful and had her whole life ahead of her but did not care for him much after the divorce. Starting at the age of 10, he was entrusted to his maternal grandfather.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/10/29/nzcbrsPMgY7QIFT.jpg" alt="Obama's parents"></p>
<p>Obama’s maternal grandfather was Stanley Dunham, who happened to be a Jewish millionaire.</p>
<p>Obama spent four years in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather and was cared for by his grandparents during the rest of the time. Many biographies mention that his grandfather had little money. However, considering Obama’s upbringing, he was far from a destitute child. He attended Punahou, an elite school, and was one of the only three black children in the school.</p>
<p>Obama had two godfathers. One was a Scottish professor named Laurence, and the other was a Jewish individual named Mino, who became the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in Kennedy’s government at the age of 35. He was instrumental in ensuring that Jewish financial consortiums controlled the American film, broadcasting, television, music, and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>Mino recommended Obama to various financial consortiums, and he also introduced him to his future wife. </p>
<p>Michelle, Obama’s wife, is the daughter of a black rabbi and, like Obama, belongs to the black Jewish community.</p>
<p>Now, you understand that when Obama was elected as the President of the United States, it was not a victory for the black community but rather a victory for the Jewish community. </p>
<p>Given the economic and political influence of African Americans in the United States, it was not possible to elect a representative president for them, but it was possible for the Jewish community.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/10/29/kuKctzSXsyg317f.jpg" alt="Obama lays flowers at Wailing Wall"></p>
<p>According to Jewish religious law, the Halacha, anyone who converts to Judaism or is born to a Jewish mother is considered Jewish. </p>
<p>By this definition, Biden’s two granddaughters and their descendants will be considered Jewish in the future.</p>
<p>I’ve seen people claim that former President George W. Bush’s mother, Barbara, is Jewish, so they argue that George W. Bush was actually a white Jewish person. However, I disagree with this viewpoint; it oversimplifies the matter.</p>
<p>The Bush family is distinct from the Obama family. The Bush family initially made their fortune in steel manufacturing through their great-grandfather. Later, they married into the Walker family, a prominent financial dynasty, turning the Bush family into an influential, wealthy family. They are a typical Anglo-Saxon white family. Although George W. Bush’s grandfather married a Jewish woman, the Bush family’s Anglo-Saxon heritage clearly outweighs their Jewish heritage. Therefore, they cannot be considered Jewish. In contrast, Obama relied more on Jewish influences, so he can be seen as part of the black Jewish influence.</p>
<p>Today, the Jewish elite in the United States is somewhat like the descendants of Spanish and Portuguese people who intermarried with the locals in South America, giving rise to the Brazilian and Mexican populations. Similarly, the Jewish elite in the United States, after mixing bloodlines in Europe (including Russia) and Asia, moved to America, where they intermarried with English and German descendants, creating a group of mixed-blood aristocrats.</p>
<p><strong>In simpler terms, the Jewish elite in the United States today is comparable to the Brahmin caste in India.</strong></p>
<p>The bloodline of the American Jewish elite class is not so pure, and what binds them together is financial and political interests rather than religion and lineage. It’s as if a group of wealthy people gathered together and established a private club, where having money and some family connections was the key to entry. While many of them may have Jewish blood to varying degrees, some may even practice Judaism, the core reason uniting them is their mutual interests.</p>
<p>They have long transformed into an elite class that extends its influence through intermarriage and other means, rather than being a nation bound by pure blood relations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-Three"><a href="#Part-Three" class="headerlink" title="Part Three"></a>Part Three</h2><p>My second point is that Jewish people are fundamentally not a noble, kind, resilient, or wise ethnic group, nor are they “God’s chosen people” as they claim. <strong>They are essentially similar to other ethnicities, driven by the same desires of love, hate, greed, anger, and ignorance, and they are not inherently superior. The most significant difference is their ability to make money.</strong></p>
<p>Claims about respecting knowledge, valuing education, and having faith are similar to a high-end wristwatch worn by Li Ka-shing – these are tools used by the wealthy to package themselves.</p>
<p>Jews strive for not only wealth but also fame. They use money to establish their reputation, as wealth and fame are often interconnected.</p>
<p>Their ability to make money is a result of unique historical circumstances. </p>
<p>After Jews left Western Asia, they primarily migrated to Europe. Due to differences in religious beliefs and cultural practices, they were initially required to live separately from Christians and often isolated themselves in specific areas of cities or towns, using hedges, walls, and ditches to establish Jewish communities.</p>
<p>During the day, Jews left their communities to earn a living, returning in the evenings to engage in social and communal activities.</p>
<p>Their primary means of earning money were through trade and moneylending.</p>
<p>The assertion that Jews had a natural talent for business is baseless. Rather, they were compelled into these professions due to their status as outsiders in European countries, which were cautious about allocating land to them or allowing them into skilled trades, similar to how the United States restricts China’s access to the semiconductor industry today. Thus, Jews had little choice but to engage in business, particularly in finance.</p>
<p>The term “finance” may seem prestigious, but it primarily involved usury.</p>
<p>During that time, both the Christian and Islamic worlds allowed lending but prohibited usury. </p>
<p>According to Jacques Le Goff’s “Your Money or Your Life,” Jews had initially refrained from usury as well. It was only when they were cornered by Christians and left with no other means of survival that they started seeking justifications in the Old Testament, particularly in Deuteronomy, which allowed Jews to lend money at interest to non-Jews. Jews exploited this loophole and, for thousands of years, became powerful through usury.</p>
<p>During the economic depression in medieval Europe, people turned to Jews for loans, and Jews manipulated prices and engaged in various activities to become financial (usury) tycoons.</p>
<p>The Medici family in Italy was especially cunning. They invented a method of falsifying accounts in the name of exchanging foreign currency for transaction fees, which was essentially a form of usury. This innovation allowed the Medici family to rise to power. In the end, family members even entered the Papacy, gradually whitewashing the financial industry in the Christian world.</p>
<p>Because of their financial practices, Jews had a bad reputation in medieval Europe, often being associated with terms like miserly and stingy. Shylock, the main antagonist in Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice,” is an example of this characterization.</p>
<p>In reality, Jews have been involved in numerous unsavory activities for profit. To make money, they have consistently crossed ethical boundaries.</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, the Sassoon family, a Jewish drug trafficking syndicate, was responsible for smuggling opium into China.</p>
<p>Don’t misunderstand; it wasn’t just one Jewish family doing this. Several Jewish families, including the Sassoons, Kadoories, Hardoons, Abrahams, Solomons, Ezrzes, Toegs, Hayims, and Slphers, were involved in this drug trade. The Sassoon family was the largest among them.</p>
<p>The Sassoon family originally thrived in Baghdad, holding the position of Chief Treasurer in the local government. When a new leader came to power in Baghdad and began cracking down on Jewish moneylenders, the Sassoons reported him to higher authorities in an attempt to remove him. This scheme backfired, leading to their hasty escape in 1829 to England. Three years later, they obtained British citizenship and later settled in Mumbai, India.</p>
<p>In India, the Sassoon family’s business began to flourish again. They engaged in trade while simultaneously smuggling opium into China. They found opium to be the most profitable trade. In 1836, of the 30,000 crates of opium that entered China through legal channels, 97% was controlled by Jewish drug trafficking syndicates. The Sassoon family held a 20% share in this drug trade. The Sassoons, led by David Sassoon, entered the opium trade with all eight of his sons.</p>
<p>Later, after Lin Zexu’s efforts to confiscate and destroy opium, it was the opium trafficked by Jewish syndicates, with the Sassoon family as the leader, that Lin Zexu seized and destroyed.</p>
<p>Upset by the confiscation of their opium, the Sassoon family joined forces with their Jewish relatives, the Rothschild family, to raise money to persuade the British Parliament to start the First Opium War, which ended in the victory of British and Jewish interests.</p>
<p>After China’s defeat in the Opium War, the Sassoon family and their eight sons established the Sassoon and Sons trading house in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. They became heavily involved in opium trafficking in these areas, and David Sassoon eventually became the world’s largest drug lord.</p>
<p>Many media outlets often praise the saying that Jewish children are raised on honeyed books, but they never mention that the wealth of Jewish families was originally built on usury and drug trafficking.</p>
<p>In other countries, the behavior was the same. When Jewish refugees arrived in Palestine in 1947, they held banners proclaiming, “The Germans destroyed our families and homes-don’t you destroy our hopes.” Over seventy years later, Palestinians are trapped in Gaza, living in what is essentially a prison.</p>
<p>At the time of the Soviet Union’s dissolution, six out of seven oligarchs who divided up the country’s wealth were Jewish.</p>
<p>Jews may tell you about how terribly they suffered at the hands of Hitler, but they never mention that at the time, the Jewish population in Germany was 560,000, making up only 1.5% of the total population. Yet, they controlled key sectors of the German economy and held approximately 1/16 of the nation’s economic wealth. Hitler, in “Mein Kampf,” argued that Jewish people held an almost absolute sway over Germany’s economy, and this perception fueled his drive to eradicate them. The Jewish penchant for usury had always harmed their reputation.</p>
<p>In fact, the social status of Jews before World War II was quite similar to the position of Chinese in Southeast Asia: they were good at making money, had no political status, often acted as white gloves for politicians, and would be blamed when things went wrong and were used as scapegoats. The periodic anti-Chinese pogroms in Southeast Asia were similar in nature to Hitler’s persecution of Jews.</p>
<p>Jews are good at making money, and this enables them to invest heavily in elite education. Education is the key to success, as those who receive undergraduate education will naturally have a much higher success rate than those with only a middle school education. This investment in education has led to a surge of talent among Jews and their acquisition of 22% of Nobel Prizes, producing many top talents in various fields.</p>
<p>We should applaud Jews for their commitment to education, but this doesn’t mean that “anything is right when they have money.” Building one’s wealth through usury and drug trafficking is always highly disreputable. To claim that Jews are noble, kind, resilient, and wise, or to attribute them to a high-class ethnicity, is entirely unfounded. So, when it comes to lavishing praise on them, just remember that their success was built on usury and drug trafficking.</p>
<h2 id="Part-Four"><a href="#Part-Four" class="headerlink" title="Part Four"></a>Part Four</h2><p>After World War II, a large number of Jewish people fled to the United States, seeking refuge and tightly clinging to the American dream.</p>
<p>They had learned from the horrors of the Holocaust and decided it was time for a major shift in their strategy.</p>
<p>They expanded their influence beyond the realm of finance on Wall Street, realizing that controlling the media and culture were equally vital. </p>
<p>With the help of individuals like Minow, whom I mentioned earlier, Jewish people who arrived in the United States from around the world solidified their control over some of the world’s most prestigious media conglomerates, film studios, record labels, and more.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the mainstream media is dominated by outlets like Reuters, the BBC, The Times, The Guardian, and The Telegraph. </p>
<p>Reuters, founded in 1850, was established by Jews. The Times is associated with the Jewish Murdoch family, and while Murdoch’s Jewish heritage may not be entirely pure, he remains a prominent figure. The BBC was established with funding from several major consortiums, and The Daily Telegraph is owned by Canadian Conrad Black, whose Hollinger Inc. also controls the Chicago Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post, and more. The Guardian is currently owned by a foundation.</p>
<p>In the United States, the situation is similar. For example, Joe Roth, the head of Disney Studios, is Jewish, and Time Warner’s former CEO, Gerald Levin, is Jewish. Their influence extends to ESPN, HBO, Warner Music, Time magazine, Sports Illustrated, People, Fortune, and more. Sumner Redstone, the owner of Viacom, is also Jewish. Their reach not only includes publishing houses but also extends to over four thousand Blockbuster video rental stores and media networks like Showtime and MTV. ABC Television is controlled by Jewish businessman Lawrence Tisch, while NBC is under the influence of Jewish businessman David Sarnoff. The New York Times is owned by the Jewish Sulzberger family, which also controls The Boston Globe, seven television stations, twelve magazines, three book publishing companies, and more. The Washington Post is owned by the Jewish Meyer family, and The Wall Street Journal is controlled by Jewish businessman Peter Kann.</p>
<p>The founders of major Hollywood studios like Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount, MGM, Columbia, and 20th Century Fox were almost exclusively Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe and Russia.</p>
<p>Even companies like Facebook and Twitter have Jewish connections.</p>
<p>The majority of the world’s most prominent media organizations, which we often hear about, are under the control or influence of Jewish individuals and families.</p>
<p>In the realm of ideas and culture, Jewish people also maintain a firm grip. In the universities on the East Coast of the United States, one-third of the professors are Jewish. In the fields of American literature, drama, and music, Jewish writers constitute 60% of the top talent. In the Washington and New York City metropolitan areas, 40% of law firm partners are Jewish.</p>
<p>Many of the ideas and philosophies we encounter today were created by Jewish intellectuals. These ideas, once disseminated through the media they control, gradually influence the entire world and also deeply affect domestic populations.</p>
<p>In films and literature, they extensively praise Jewish people. Consequently, teachers during my primary and secondary education would often stand at the front of the classroom and say, “Jewish people are a suffering nation, a hardworking nation, a resilient nation.”</p>
<p>They also suppress any criticism or dissent against Jewish people. Except in countries that still possess media sovereignty, like China, it has become politically incorrect to speak negatively of Jewish people, to doubt them, or even to discuss their identity.</p>
<p>Jewish people, who had suffered so terribly during World War II, were able to regain a positive public image worldwide by gaining control over the finance, media, and culture of the United States.</p>
<h2 id="Part-Five"><a href="#Part-Five" class="headerlink" title="Part Five"></a>Part Five</h2><p>Today, the relationship between Jewish people and the Chinese nation is generally one of tension and hostility.</p>
<p>I use the term “generally” because not all Jewish people are our enemies. We must respect the facts and avoid inciting hatred. Otherwise, we would be no different from Hitler. Some Jewish people do stand on our side, and the Jewish community is not a monolith; there are partners who engage in vibrant business relations with us.</p>
<p>My questioning of Jewish people primarily stems from the fact that some Jewish individuals provoked us.</p>
<p>As key players in American ideology, Jewish people have played the role of ideological vanguards and shock troops in suppressing China’s rise.</p>
<p>In the current Biden administration, officials such as Secretary of State Blinken, White House Chief of Staff Klain, Treasury Secretary Yellen, Attorney General Garland, Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas, Director of National Intelligence Haines, Deputy Secretary of State Sherman, U.S. Science and Technology Advisor Lander, National Cyber Director Neuberger, CIA Deputy Director Cohen, and Assistant Secretary of Health Levine are all Jewish.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/10/29/SX7c5tTzdG4RFCf.jpg" alt="Biden's Cabinet"></p>
<p>By the way, in the recent history of the Federal Reserve in the United States, five out of the last six Chairmen have been Jewish.</p>
<p>In the Biden administration, Jewish individuals hold key positions in foreign affairs, finance, justice, homeland security, national intelligence, technology, and more. They are deeply involved in almost every aspect. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has been increasingly pressuring China, from the COVID-19 pandemic to Xinjiang cotton. The initial attacks on China are often carried under the banner of Western moral righteousness, followed by a wave of propaganda against China. To say that Jewish people are good partners of the Chinese nation, I simply don’t believe it.</p>
<p>While the Anglo-Saxon community has deployed aircraft carriers to the South China Sea to threaten China militarily, Jewish individuals have been working through media outlets like the BBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and others to smear and stigmatize China. They are brainwashing the Chinese people, imposing a form of spiritual colonization.</p>
<p>Even when China is under such relentless attack, you are not allowed to say a word against Jewish people. If you do, you are branded as a nationalist, anti-human, or politically incorrect.</p>
<p>But I’ll still say it.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some Jewish people who stand with us, and we need to clarify this relationship. We cannot generalize about Jewish people. Our views must be based on facts and guided by our interests.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of writing this article today is to break the past superstitions about the Jewish people and inform everyone of the true nature of this community. In summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jewish people’s ability to earn money is a result of historical conditions and religious and ethnic struggles.</li>
<li>After earning money, Jewish people have invested heavily in education, leading to a high success rate. We can learn from their achievements, but we should not idolize them.</li>
<li>Since World War II, Jewish people have controlled the world’s top media outlets, using this as a vanguard to launch an ideological attack on China. We must maintain a clear mind, be decisive, and not be led by Jewish individuals.</li>
<li>Jewish people excel in the fields of finance and media, as making money is the easiest in the finance sector, and the media serves as a cover, thus creating a multi-generational exploitation system. Jewish people in the financial sector are like leeches, and they are currently attached to the United States, with a high likelihood of attaching themselves to China in the future. We must be highly vigilant from the outset in the fields of finance and media and guard against Jewish individuals and their agents infiltrating China’s finance and media.</li>
</ol>
<p>While we don’t want to encourage hatred, some people have thrown dirty water at us, and sooner or later, the score will need to be settled.</p>
