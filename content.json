On October 7th, following a command from Hamas militants, 5,000 rockets were launched from the Gaza Strip towards Israel, while Hamas launched an attack on the Israeli Defense Forces from land, sea, and air. To be honest, this move caught Israel off guard. Israel lost 21 settlements in a row, several military camps, dozens of armored tanks were seized, and they even captured a brigadier general. Such a brilliant achievement, not even the former regional military powers like Egypt or Syria had ever achieved. However, Hamas has limited capabilities, and despite their successful surprise attack, they struggled to sustain their momentum. On the other hand, Israel is gearing up for a massive mobilization and has already called up 300,000 troops. If everything goes as expected, Israel is about to launch a large-scale counterattack against Hamas. So, what is the background of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and what is the underlying logic? 1. The Historical Origins of the Israel-Palestine ConflictThe core of the conflict between Israel and Palestine revolves around the question of who the land of Palestine belongs to. Israel claims unequivocally: ‚ÄúThis is the land of our ancestors!‚Äù To substantiate their claim, the Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, specifically took out a Bible and read it at the United Nations Security Council: ‚ÄúI will give to you and your descendants after you, the land where you are an alien, the whole land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.‚Äù (Genesis 17:8) Then, Danon held up the Bible and said, ‚ÄúThis is our title deed!‚Äù This statement may sound like it has a solid reasoning, but the problem is that the Bible is just a religious scripture, and it‚Äôs not a historical document! Actually, Jews first appeared in the Mesopotamian plain of Western Asia, and their ancestors were part of the ancient Semitic people. Later, to escape disasters, the Jews migrated to the eastern part of the Nile Delta, which is why they were called the Hebrews, meaning ‚Äúpeople who crossed over.‚Äù If the account in the Book of Exodus in the Bible is credible, these Jews were enslaved by the ancient Egyptians in the Nile region and, under the leadership of Abraham, they ‚Äúleft Egypt‚Äù and came to ‚ÄúCanaan‚Äù, where they established a kingdom. You see, even the Jews were newcomers at one point. So, were there indigenous people in the ‚ÄúCanaan‚Äù region? We don‚Äôt know. Therefore, even if Israel presents the Bible, it can‚Äôt prove that they are the indigenous people of this land. In the 1st century BC, the Roman Empire conquered the Jewish state, destroyed the Jerusalem Temple, and renamed the land ‚ÄúPalestine.‚Äù The Jews were expelled from Palestine, and the Jewish state of antiquity was thereby destroyed. In 638 AD, Arab forces occupied Jerusalem and introduced Islam. During Arab rule in Palestine, they continuously moved into the region and merged with the local indigenous population, forming the Arab population of Palestine, the Palestinians. Subsequently, this land was successively conquered by the Ottoman Empire and the British, and after World War I, it became a British mandate territory known as British-administered Palestine. You see, it was the Romans who destroyed the ancient Jewish state, not the Palestinians. Anti-Semitism was proposed by Europeans, not Palestinians. Nazi Germany‚Äôs genocide of Jews was not carried out by Palestinians. So, what does the historical suffering of the Jewish people have to do with the current Palestinian population? Palestinians gradually formed 700 years after the fall of the ancient Jewish state, and it can‚Äôt be said that they ‚Äústole land from Jews.‚Äù However, due to the widespread anti-Semitism in Europe in the 19th century, the ideology and movement of Jewish Zionism emerged. Countless Jews began to think that their continuous wandering was not a solution and that they needed to establish their own state. But all the land in Europe was already claimed. Where could they establish their nation? Thinking that their ancestors once established a state in the ‚ÄúCanaan‚Äù region, they decided to settle there. So, under the guidance of the ‚ÄúJewish return movement,‚Äù a large number of Jews moved to Palestine and established more than 300 settlements there. But the land had been inhabited by Palestinians for over a thousand years; you can‚Äôt just claim it as your own because your ancestors lived there. As a result, there was constant bloodshed between Jews and the indigenous Palestinian people. After World War II, the United Nations was established to address some of the world‚Äôs most complex issues. On April 28, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly held a special committee meeting to specifically discuss the Palestine issue. At that time, Jews had significant influence in both the UK and the US, especially in the financial sector, controlling the resources of Western countries. So, under the initiative of the UK and the US, the United Nations passed Resolution 181, which agreed to the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. So, what about the Palestinians living on this land? No worries, just set aside a piece of land for them. Therefore, the resolution stipulated that in 1948, the British mandate rule would end in the Palestinian region, and Jews would establish Israel (about 11,000 square miles), and Palestinians would establish Palestine (about 8,600 square miles). However, the surrounding Arab countries strongly opposed this. Why should we give land to newcomers just because of a UN resolution? So, on May 14, 1948, after Israel was established, the next day, neighboring Arab countries declared war on Israel. As a result, the Arab countries performed poorly in the war and were defeated. In the following decades, there were four more wars between Arab countries and Israel, and each of them concluded with Israel‚Äôs victory. During each of these wars, Israel‚Äôs territory expanded, and the entire Palestinian region, including the area designated for the Palestinian state, came under Israeli control. After occupying the Palestinian territory, Israel began to build Jewish settlements with its strong military power, gradually encroaching on Palestinian land. Up to the present day, Israel has taken over more than 70% of Palestinian land, leaving Palestine with only the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank. Although in 1967, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 242, demanding Israel‚Äôs withdrawal from the occupied territories and the dismantling of settlements, Israel refused to comply. However, the prolonged conflict also caused significant internal damage to Israel. Simultaneously, the occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank led to Palestinian resentment, resulting in sporadic suicide bombings and other attacks, keeping Israel on edge. In 2002, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon came up with a new plan. Instead of pursuing further occupation of Palestinian territories, he unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Then, Israel constructed a separation wall around Gaza to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian separation, with the aim of completely resolving the issue of attacks. So, the nightmare for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip began, where they have essentially lived in a large prison from birth. It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to call it a prison. In the air, Israel destroyed the only airport in the Gaza Strip, cutting off air traffic. On the ground, Israel constructed a wall around Gaza that stretches for tens of kilometers and reaches heights of more than ten meters. The wall is equipped with searchlights and guard towers at regular intervals, with machine guns mounted on them. Within a 300-meter range of the separation wall is a buffer zone, and anyone, whether an adult or a child, who enters this zone is subject to being shot on sight. Even Trump would acknowledge the expertise of such measures. At sea, Israel imposed a blockade, allowing Gaza fishermen to fish only up to 4.8 kilometers from the shore. If they go beyond that limit, they face gunfire. As a result, all land, sea, and air traffic to and from the Gaza Strip has been cut off, and the 3 million people living there are squeezed into this narrow area, which is 40 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide. Imagine how desperate life is for the people there, as they can‚Äôt leave for their entire lives. What‚Äôs even more unreasonable is that after Israel built the wall, they initiated an embargo on goods going into Gaza. Apart from strictly limited food and water, no other materials, such as building supplies, medicines, cement, pipes, electronics, and more, are allowed to enter. Can you imagine that in the Gaza Strip, a child playing soccer and accidentally entering the buffer zone would be mercilessly killed? Can you imagine that Gaza fishermen, just going out to sea to catch fish, would be sunk by Israeli warships? Can you imagine that water tanks on the rooftops of Gaza residents‚Äô homes would be riddled with dozens of bullet holes just because Israeli soldiers were bored? Can you imagine that when a baby in Gaza has a fever, Israel doesn‚Äôt allow fever-reducing medicine to enter? It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that there is a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip almost every day. However, wherever there is oppression, there is resistance. Israel‚Äôs blockade and oppression in the Gaza Strip have given rise to the Palestinian Islamic resistance movement (Hamas). The Gaza Strip was originally ruled by the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), but after Fatah signed a reconciliation ‚ÄúOslo Agreement‚Äù with Israel, it not only became submissive to Israel but also began sending Palestinians to work in Israel as a means to earn intermediary fees, which increasingly caused resentment among the residents of the Gaza Strip. In 2007, Fatah and Hamas erupted in a fierce internal conflict in the Gaza Strip, ultimately leading to Hamas driving Fatah out of the Gaza Strip. So, the current Palestinian authority actually has two parts: Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Hamas‚Äôs manifesto is not recognizing Israel and aiming to recapture the entire Palestinian territory, so they have been active in recent years. They have dug numerous tunnels from the Gaza Strip to Egypt, bypassing Israel‚Äôs separation wall, to smuggle various necessary supplies, especially weapons and ammunition. With weapons and ammunition, Hamas began launching frequent attacks on Israel and occasionally firing rockets at Israel. Originally, both sides were accustomed to this tit-for-tat, but on October 4th, a sudden incident ignited a spark. On that day, several hundred Israelis, under the protection of Israeli police, entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque and caused a commotion. This angered Hamas. You see, the Al-Aqsa Mosque is located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, which Muslims call the ‚ÄúNoble Sanctuary.‚Äù It is the third holiest site in Islam, following the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and the Prophet‚Äôs Mosque in Medina. Now, with Israelis barging in, it‚Äôs a blatant insult! So, on October 7th, Hamas launched a large-scale attack code-named ‚ÄúAqsa Flood,‚Äù launching a comprehensive assault on Israel from land, sea, and air. This marks the most serious Israeli-Palestinian conflict in fifty years. 2. Behind the Israeli-Palestinian ConflictOn the surface, this Israeli-Palestinian conflict may appear as a desperate resistance by the Palestinians against long-term Israeli oppression. However, fundamentally, this conflict is still a power struggle among major nations. First, it‚Äôs a spillover from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been ongoing for a year and a half, with NATO continuously escalating its actions and challenging Russia‚Äôs bottom line, this war has increasingly begun to affect the world and carry the risk of spillover. This spillover has both passive and active factors. The passive factors are that major powers have their attention diverted, allowing smaller countries to exploit the situation. As we know, the world is full of conflicts today, ranging from geopolitical disputes, border clashes, and ethnic tensions to resource conflicts, energy disputes, environmental concerns, and economic disputes, among others. In short, any of these conflicts can trigger a war. Before World War II, the world was in a constant state of war and conflict. However, after World War II, the nations of the world, fearing the devastating consequences of a global war, established the United Nations and other mechanisms to maintain peace. Conflicts around the world significantly decreased. Is the United Nations mechanism really effective? On the surface, it may seem so, but in reality, it‚Äôs the influence of major world powers that plays the key role. The United States, at the zenith of its power, and the Soviet Union had considerable clout. In their respective spheres of influence, whenever they spoke, most small countries had to consider their words carefully. This was even more pronounced after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. If the United States didn‚Äôt want a war to continue, a single word from them could usually bring a swift resolution, and those that didn‚Äôt comply, like Saddam, faced the consequences. This state was referred to as the ‚ÄúU.S.-led global order‚Äù or ‚Äúoffshore balancing.‚Äù However, the situation has changed now. On one hand, the United States is heavily focused on dealing with China in economic, political, and military realms. This has led to a massive redeployment of its resources. The U.S. even withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving a power vacuum in other regions. On the other hand, the United States is stoking the Russia-Ukraine war, providing a considerable amount of money and military aid to Ukraine, which naturally leaves fewer resources for other areas. Consequently, America‚Äôs control over the globe has diminished. Some small countries that have conflicts with neighboring nations but were previously restrained by U.S. influence see this as a ‚Äústrategic opportunity.‚Äù They think that the U.S. is too preoccupied with countering China and Russia to meddle in their affairs. As long as they act swiftly, the U.S. will have no choice but to accept the status quo. Hence, in recent years, we‚Äôve seen conflicts escalating worldwide. It began with the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, followed by the Kosovo conflict, and then the large-scale civil war in Libya. Even Argentina has been talking about retaking the Falkland Islands. From this perspective, the new round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict is rooted in the irreconcilable differences between Israel and Palestine. Secondly, it‚Äôs a consequence of the power struggle between China and the United States in the Middle East. Currently, China and the United States are engaged in fierce competition in various domains, and diplomacy is no exception. The most intense rivalry between the two superpowers is not just in Southeast Asia; it‚Äôs in the Middle East. However, China and the United States employ different strategies in the Middle East. After Saudi Arabia and Iran achieved a historic reconciliation mediated by China, the United States felt a significant shock. It has repeatedly claimed that China‚Äôs influence has penetrated the Middle East and that the United States is falling behind. Consequently, the Biden administration has taken a series of actions in the Middle East with the aim of reasserting American influence in the region. Recently, the United States has been pushing for the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal on August 9, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are working on an agreement to pave the way for the normalization of Saudi-Israeli relations. Under this agreement, Saudi Arabia would recognize Israel and establish diplomatic ties. In exchange, Israel would make concessions on the Palestinian issue. Saudi Arabia would receive security guarantees and civil nuclear assistance from the U.S. Additionally, as a reciprocal gesture, Saudi Arabia may increase its oil production, which could help reduce U.S. inflation, benefiting Biden‚Äôs political prospects. In this negotiation process between Saudi Arabia and the United States, the plight of the Palestinian people is essentially just a bargaining chip. In other words, if the United States offers conditions that satisfy Saudi Arabia, then the Palestinian cause is likely to be sacrificed. This development has significant implications for the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia is a major Sunni power in the Islamic world. If Saudi Arabia reconciles with Israel, it could set a precedent for other Islamic countries in the Middle East to do the same. For Palestinians who have suffered from Israeli humanitarian crises for decades, this means an even bleaker future with fewer hopes of stability. It implies that the Palestinians could become more isolated within the Islamic world. From this perspective, the Palestinians are determined to prevent the successful normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 3 The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has caused significant trouble for the United StatesFrom the current situation, there is a significant possibility that Israel will seize this opportunity during the ongoing attacks, potentially even considering a full-scale assault on Gaza. After all, airstrikes and blockades alone won‚Äôt quell Israeli public anger, nor will they completely eliminate the threat posed by Hamas. Netanyahu‚Äôs already precarious approval ratings are on the line. If he doesn‚Äôt capitalize on this opportunity with a tough stance to gain popular support, his political future in Israel may be in jeopardy. However, if Israel escalates its actions, it could bring significant trouble to the United States. First, it would divert U.S. attentionIn essence, Israel undoubtedly aims to solve the Gaza issue once and for all, as this place has become a festering sore. Palestinians suffer, and Israelis also suffer because it‚Äôs not reasonable to have to act like thieves every day; there should be a way to put an end to it. As long as Gaza remains, generation after generation of Palestinian children receive anti-Israel education from a young age. Even if Hamas were eliminated, new generations of Hamas would emerge, and the threat to Israel would continue endlessly. However, the issue is that it‚Äôs not 100 years ago! If both sides are stuck in the urban warfare of Gaza, and Israel can‚Äôt distinguish between Hamas militants and civilians, civilian casualties on a large scale are inevitable. At that time, forget about UN intervention, even the neighboring Arab countries would likely remain passive. In these days, Arab countries are urgently coordinating. Iranian President Raisi talked to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the phone to discuss the Gaza situation, emphasizing the necessity to prevent Israel from committing war crimes against the Palestinians. It‚Äôs worth noting that this is the first national leader communication between Saudi Arabia and Iran after their reconciliation. Hezbollah in Lebanon has also begun firing rockets and shells towards Israeli positions to show support. The 7th Division of the Syrian Army and one of the three elite units, the 4th Mechanized Division, are heading to the southern Daraa region, posing a threat to the Golan Heights. With such public sentiment, if Israel launches a large-scale attack on Gaza, resulting in the deaths and injuries of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, there is no doubt that it will inflame the Arab world with immense anger. At this point, even if Saudi Arabia maintains an ambiguous stance, it must take a position. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself faces significant internal opposition and would not dare to bear the accusation of ‚Äúbetraying the Arab world‚Äù again. In the event of further deterioration, it is not inconceivable that the blood of the Palestinian people could become the adhesive binding the Arab world, prompting them to form another coalition against Israel and possibly triggering the sixth Middle East war. In this situation, the United States finds itself in a dilemma. If they persuade Israel not to retaliate on a large scale and not to invade Gaza, will Israel, already in a heated state, listen? After all, the last Israeli leader who compromised under American guidance, Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated by Israeli extremists. It is clear that Netanyahu would not want to follow in Rabin‚Äôs footsteps. If the U.S. supports Israel, they would have to move military forces to the Middle East to deter Arab countries from taking reckless actions. Currently, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, has ordered the deployment of the United States‚Äô largest and most advanced aircraft carrier strike group, the USS Gerald R. Ford, to the eastern Mediterranean. Additionally, another U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, set sail on the 13th for deployment near Israel. However, in doing so, doesn‚Äôt this mean that Biden‚Äôs strategy to withdraw from the Middle East to counter China has been rendered almost pointless? So, regardless of whether this event was orchestrated by Iran to disrupt the Saudi-Israeli reconciliation, it has objectively served to divert U.S. attention and reduce the pressure from China. The second aspect is to disrupt the United States‚Äô strategy with its allies.As we all know, in the past, the United States was the world‚Äôs superpower, and it could essentially do as it pleased in international conflicts. It often didn‚Äôt have to fear taking on multiple opponents. However, in recent years, with the decline of U.S. power, the United States has had to rely more on its allies to bolster its strategic stability. If we look at recent geopolitical contests between China and the United States, as well as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the first thing the United States has done is to form coalitions, rallying other nations and seeking a sense of ‚Äúrighteousness‚Äù through this united front. After the recent Hamas attacks, the United States is no exception. It has once again started organizing a coalition. President Biden has stated that U.S. support for Israel is rock-solid, and French President Macron has expressed solidarity with Israel. Subsequently, many Western countries, including the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and others, have mostly condemned Hamas. Even India, which has sometimes had differing positions from the U.S., has clearly expressed its support for Israel. In the Arab world, most countries support Palestine, with a few refraining from making a statement. Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately made phone calls to the foreign ministers of Middle Eastern countries, urging them to make public statements supporting Israel. It is likely that the Arab nations who received these phone calls were not pleased. It‚Äôs important to note that while some Middle Eastern countries have private dealings with Israel, **there is no country in the region that openly takes Israel‚Äôs side in the Israel-Palestine conflict. ** Why? Because in the Israel-Palestine conflict, supporting Palestine and opposing Israel not only enjoys broad public support in Muslim countries but is also the prevailing political correctness. Perhaps the United States realized that Middle Eastern countries were not buying into their stance, so they turned to their quasi-ally, Saudi Arabia, hoping that if Saudi Arabia took a stance, other countries would follow suit. So, Secretary of State Blinken personally visited Saudi Arabia to urge them to exert pressure on Hamas. However, how could Saudi Arabia openly side with Israel when it goes against domestic public opinion and the most significant political correctness in the Muslim world? Thus, under Blinken‚Äôs pressure, Saudi Arabia had no choice but to make a public statement supporting Palestine and announced the postponement of negotiations concerning the normalization of relations with Israel that the United States had been promoting. You see, Saudi Arabia initially wanted to quietly sit on the fence, but due to Blinken‚Äôs pressure, they had to take a public stance in support of Palestine. Moreover, after taking sides, they called the Iranian President to discuss the Israel-Palestine conflict. An advisor to Iran‚Äôs President, Jamsheed, later revealed, ‚ÄúDuring the 45-minute conversation, they emphasized Islamic unity and believed that the crimes of the Zionist regime and U.S. complicity were the reasons for the destructive insecurity.‚Äù After Saudi Arabia‚Äôs declaration, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and even Pakistan‚Äôs Chief of Army Staff announced their support for the Palestinian people. The Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan declared, ‚ÄúIf Israel launches a ground operation in Gaza, we will provide ballistic missile support to Palestine.‚Äù Considering that Pakistan has long been a key player for Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as Saudi Arabia drawing a red line through Pakistan to Israel: ‚ÄúYou can bomb, but you can‚Äôt enter Gaza on the ground!‚Äù From the perspective of Blinken, who has been laboring hard to rally support, this display of Arab solidarity is nothing less than a public humiliation. This fully illustrates that Blinken‚Äôs pressure tactics are not well-received. What is the core of diplomatic work? It is about finding common ground amid differences and discovering channels that both sides can accept to carry out diplomatic activities. But what about Blinken? He has always been an ideologue who prefers to talk to others from a standpoint of ‚Äústarting with the strength of the United States.‚Äù To cater to the domestic political climate that supports Israel, Blinken began globetrotting to gain political achievements, but the results turned out to be counterproductive. If it‚Äôs just Blinken losing face himself, that‚Äôs a minor issue. However, if it leads to alienation of U.S. allies and undermines the U.S. ally strategy, then it becomes a major problem. The third factor is forcing the United States to seek cooperation with China.On October 7th, a delegation from the United States Senate visited China, bringing new opportunities for improved U.S.-China relations. On the one hand, the Biden administration, including Blinken and Sullivan, faces the challenge that any concessions to China could lead to political attacks that affect the Democratic Party‚Äôs electoral prospects. Therefore, having Senate Majority Leaders with a more detached stance allows for greater flexibility. On the other hand, the visiting senators were mostly elected at the local government level, representing the interests of certain states, and have a broader basis for cooperation with China. In the past, due to significant differences on various issues, U.S.-China cooperation was primarily limited to climate cooperation and combating drug-related matters. However, this visit included discussions on bilateral trade and investment, as well as resolving regional conflicts. What regional conflicts need to be addressed? Primarily the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and now, adding the Israel-Palestine conflict to the mix. This clearly demonstrates that the United States, even if unwilling, must acknowledge that it needs to cooperate with China to address regional conflicts. If the United States does not want its global strategy and regional balance to be thrown into chaos by major international developments, it must seek cooperation with China. China has consistently coordinated its position with various countries, advocating for peace and negotiations. China has sided with the Palestinian people, which aligns with its consistent stance against bullying the weak with strength. Currently, it is uncertain whether U.S. mediation will be effective, but this situation has shown that in the face of an increasingly complex international situation, severe Democratic Party electoral conditions, and worsening domestic economic difficulties, the United States will have to work with China to address certain issues. Therefore, the Israel-Palestine conflict should not be viewed solely from the perspective of the Israelis and Palestinians; it conceals complex geopolitical maneuvering. The next step is highly likely to involve Israeli retaliatory actions. The extent of this retaliation and whether it might trigger Arab world coalition intervention, as well as any new actions by China, the United States, and Russia, remain unknown. The only certainty is that since the launch of Hamas rockets, we have entered a more chaotic world.","link":"/palestine-rsrael-conflict/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Palestine-Israel Conflict","slug":"Palestine-Israel-Conflict","link":"/tags/Palestine-Israel-Conflict/"},{"name":"Great-Power Game","slug":"Great-Power-Game","link":"/tags/Great-Power-Game/"}],"categories":[]}
