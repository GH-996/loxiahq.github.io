Why do people say Israel is the father of the United States? Part OneDuring my teenage years, the Jewish people, located thousands of miles away, always appeared to me in the media with an elite disposition. They were often portrayed as a highly educated, hardworking, book-loving, financially savvy community. Many scientists, thinkers, artists, and entrepreneurs were of Jewish descent, including renowned figures such as Einstein, Picasso, Morgan, Rockefeller, Greenspan, Soros, Bloomberg, Zuckerberg, Reuters, Karajan, Freud, Kissinger, and many more. Today, the Jewish population stands at around 16 million, making up only 0.3% of the global population, yet they have received 22% of the Nobel Prizes, which is an astonishing achievement. Comparatively, consider the Romani people (with a population of 12 million) and the Kurds (with over 30 million), both of which have a similarly sized population. These two groups, however, have not achieved the same success as the Jewish community. Romani people are often associated with activities such as petty theft, dancing, and fortune-telling, and rarely engage in formal education. Kurds, on the other hand, have faced numerous conflicts and oppressions in the Middle East, and they continue to struggle for survival. Furthermore, whenever the media mentions the Jewish community, they often emphasize their history of suffering and their appreciation for help. During World War II, six million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany, and Hollywood repeatedly reminds us of the immense suffering of the Jewish people through films like ‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Pianist.‚Äù Chinese magazines in the past also focused on stories of Jewish people saved in Shanghai, highlighting the quiet reciprocation of the Jewish community. This portrayal of Jewish people has created an image of resilience mixed with sorrow. In China, Jewish people were seen as saviors ready to rescue humanity, characterized by qualities such as determination, sanctity, wisdom, wealth, kindness, and resilience. Chinese bookstores have been eager to promote this concept. Books like ‚ÄúThe Jewish Wealth Code‚Äù and ‚ÄúJewish Parenting Bedside Guide‚Äù can be found everywhere. Perhaps influenced by these books and magazines, I have heard numerous teachers passionately describe in front of the class how Jewish people are a suffering yet upwardly mobile, resilient ethnic group. Despite having minimal interactions with Jewish individuals, I did not hold any strong opinions about them. I was content with the idea that the Jewish people were seen as an inspirational group for the public. However, as I began to delve deeper into the history of various countries in recent years, Jewish names kept emerging. Initially, a few times did not bother me, but when this frequency increased, I was compelled to classify and analyze their behavior. Gradually, my impression of Jewish people began to shift. Before sharing my viewpoint, I want to clarify my reasoning. First, I am against the oversimplification and generalization of any ethnic group. I oppose extreme views and believe that issues should not be overly polarized, as extreme perspectives can lead to self-delusion. Second, I have no personal grievances with Jewish people. My understanding of this community is based on their historical actions. My analysis is solely based on facts and interests. I have contemplated the potential consequences of discussing Jewish people. I acknowledge that if I express opinions that are unfavorable to Jewish people, considering their current influence in the world media and financial sectors, I may face difficulties. However, in order to convey the truth, I have decided to continue writing. Part TwoMy first point is that today‚Äôs Jewish people no longer resemble an ethnic group linked by bloodline and Judaism but rather appear to be an elite class controlling global finance and media. This is particularly true for American Jews. Jews originated in Western Asia, migrated to Europe, and then dispersed worldwide. Their physical appearance is often similar to that of Arab people, with a typical look characterized by a lack of tall stature, dark hair, dark eyes, a prominent nose with a slight curve, and thicker nostrils. This appearance, particularly the nose, was used by the Nazis for identifying Jews. Jewish noses are relatively larger, with a slightly arched bridge and thicker nostrils, and they tend to droop at the tip, which the Nazis referred to as the ‚ÄúJewish nose.‚Äù Anyone with a shorter stature and this kind of nose was easily identified as Jewish. Chinese residents living in Europe have summarized the distinguishing characteristics of various ethnicities, stating that individuals with black hair and dark eyes who dress well are Italians, people with light hair, a serious demeanor, and no nonsense are Germans, people with dark hair, brown eyes, large noses, and a carefree attitude who like to flirt with girls are French, people with a proud expression are typically British, and those with a shorter stature, a larger nose, and an Eastern vibe are Jewish. However, if you compare the photos of some of the Jewish individuals controlling the United States today, you‚Äôll find that aside from figures like Mark Zuckerberg, many no longer have the typical Jewish appearance. Some of them have the common facial features of Caucasian Americans, like Warren Buffett, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates, and others. Moreover, this facial type is prevalent in the United States, with some individuals having golden hair and taller statures, while the standard Jewish appearance is less common. This demonstrates that the meaning of the term ‚ÄúJewish people‚Äù is evolving in today‚Äôs context. Instead of categorizing individuals solely based on historical data, we should assess them based on the interest groups they are associated with to truly understand the situation. We all know that Ivanka, the daughter of former U.S. President Donald Trump, married Jared Kushner, who is Jewish. Similarly, the current President Joe Biden‚Äôs wife and both his daughters-in-law are Jewish. Both Trump and Biden have European ancestry, with numerous intermarriages between Jewish individuals, causing a significant change in the Jewish bloodline. It‚Äôs not just white elites like Trump and Biden who have been infiltrated by Jewish individuals; even the previous President, Barack Obama, from the elite African American community, had Jewish connections. Obama‚Äôs mother was Jewish, and when she lived in Hawaii, Obama‚Äôs father, who was from Kenya, studied economics at the University of Hawaii. After they met, they quickly married, and she was only 18 years old at the time. They divorced when Obama was two years old, and his father left. Obama‚Äôs mother was young and beautiful and had her whole life ahead of her but did not care for him much after the divorce. Starting at the age of 10, he was entrusted to his maternal grandfather. Obama‚Äôs maternal grandfather was Stanley Dunham, who happened to be a Jewish millionaire. Obama spent four years in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather and was cared for by his grandparents during the rest of the time. Many biographies mention that his grandfather had little money. However, considering Obama‚Äôs upbringing, he was far from a destitute child. He attended Punahou, an elite school, and was one of the only three black children in the school. Obama had two godfathers. One was a Scottish professor named Laurence, and the other was a Jewish individual named Mino, who became the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in Kennedy‚Äôs government at the age of 35. He was instrumental in ensuring that Jewish financial consortiums controlled the American film, broadcasting, television, music, and entertainment industries. Mino recommended Obama to various financial consortiums, and he also introduced him to his future wife. Michelle, Obama‚Äôs wife, is the daughter of a black rabbi and, like Obama, belongs to the black Jewish community. Now, you understand that when Obama was elected as the President of the United States, it was not a victory for the black community but rather a victory for the Jewish community. Given the economic and political influence of African Americans in the United States, it was not possible to elect a representative president for them, but it was possible for the Jewish community. According to Jewish religious law, the Halacha, anyone who converts to Judaism or is born to a Jewish mother is considered Jewish. By this definition, Biden‚Äôs two granddaughters and their descendants will be considered Jewish in the future. I‚Äôve seen people claim that former President George W. Bush‚Äôs mother, Barbara, is Jewish, so they argue that George W. Bush was actually a white Jewish person. However, I disagree with this viewpoint; it oversimplifies the matter. The Bush family is distinct from the Obama family. The Bush family initially made their fortune in steel manufacturing through their great-grandfather. Later, they married into the Walker family, a prominent financial dynasty, turning the Bush family into an influential, wealthy family. They are a typical Anglo-Saxon white family. Although George W. Bush‚Äôs grandfather married a Jewish woman, the Bush family‚Äôs Anglo-Saxon heritage clearly outweighs their Jewish heritage. Therefore, they cannot be considered Jewish. In contrast, Obama relied more on Jewish influences, so he can be seen as part of the black Jewish influence. Today, the Jewish elite in the United States is somewhat like the descendants of Spanish and Portuguese people who intermarried with the locals in South America, giving rise to the Brazilian and Mexican populations. Similarly, the Jewish elite in the United States, after mixing bloodlines in Europe (including Russia) and Asia, moved to America, where they intermarried with English and German descendants, creating a group of mixed-blood aristocrats. In simpler terms, the Jewish elite in the United States today is comparable to the Brahmin caste in India. The bloodline of the American Jewish elite class is not so pure, and what binds them together is financial and political interests rather than religion and lineage. It‚Äôs as if a group of wealthy people gathered together and established a private club, where having money and some family connections was the key to entry. While many of them may have Jewish blood to varying degrees, some may even practice Judaism, the core reason uniting them is their mutual interests. They have long transformed into an elite class that extends its influence through intermarriage and other means, rather than being a nation bound by pure blood relations. Part ThreeMy second point is that Jewish people are fundamentally not a noble, kind, resilient, or wise ethnic group, nor are they ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs chosen people‚Äù as they claim. They are essentially similar to other ethnicities, driven by the same desires of love, hate, greed, anger, and ignorance, and they are not inherently superior. The most significant difference is their ability to make money. Claims about respecting knowledge, valuing education, and having faith are similar to a high-end wristwatch worn by Li Ka-shing ‚Äì these are tools used by the wealthy to package themselves. Jews strive for not only wealth but also fame. They use money to establish their reputation, as wealth and fame are often interconnected. Their ability to make money is a result of unique historical circumstances. After Jews left Western Asia, they primarily migrated to Europe. Due to differences in religious beliefs and cultural practices, they were initially required to live separately from Christians and often isolated themselves in specific areas of cities or towns, using hedges, walls, and ditches to establish Jewish communities. During the day, Jews left their communities to earn a living, returning in the evenings to engage in social and communal activities. Their primary means of earning money were through trade and moneylending. The assertion that Jews had a natural talent for business is baseless. Rather, they were compelled into these professions due to their status as outsiders in European countries, which were cautious about allocating land to them or allowing them into skilled trades, similar to how the United States restricts China‚Äôs access to the semiconductor industry today. Thus, Jews had little choice but to engage in business, particularly in finance. The term ‚Äúfinance‚Äù may seem prestigious, but it primarily involved usury. During that time, both the Christian and Islamic worlds allowed lending but prohibited usury. According to Jacques Le Goff‚Äôs ‚ÄúYour Money or Your Life,‚Äù Jews had initially refrained from usury as well. It was only when they were cornered by Christians and left with no other means of survival that they started seeking justifications in the Old Testament, particularly in Deuteronomy, which allowed Jews to lend money at interest to non-Jews. Jews exploited this loophole and, for thousands of years, became powerful through usury. During the economic depression in medieval Europe, people turned to Jews for loans, and Jews manipulated prices and engaged in various activities to become financial (usury) tycoons. The Medici family in Italy was especially cunning. They invented a method of falsifying accounts in the name of exchanging foreign currency for transaction fees, which was essentially a form of usury. This innovation allowed the Medici family to rise to power. In the end, family members even entered the Papacy, gradually whitewashing the financial industry in the Christian world. Because of their financial practices, Jews had a bad reputation in medieval Europe, often being associated with terms like miserly and stingy. Shylock, the main antagonist in Shakespeare‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Merchant of Venice,‚Äù is an example of this characterization. In reality, Jews have been involved in numerous unsavory activities for profit. To make money, they have consistently crossed ethical boundaries. In the late Qing Dynasty, the Sassoon family, a Jewish drug trafficking syndicate, was responsible for smuggling opium into China. Don‚Äôt misunderstand; it wasn‚Äôt just one Jewish family doing this. Several Jewish families, including the Sassoons, Kadoories, Hardoons, Abrahams, Solomons, Ezrzes, Toegs, Hayims, and Slphers, were involved in this drug trade. The Sassoon family was the largest among them. The Sassoon family originally thrived in Baghdad, holding the position of Chief Treasurer in the local government. When a new leader came to power in Baghdad and began cracking down on Jewish moneylenders, the Sassoons reported him to higher authorities in an attempt to remove him. This scheme backfired, leading to their hasty escape in 1829 to England. Three years later, they obtained British citizenship and later settled in Mumbai, India. In India, the Sassoon family‚Äôs business began to flourish again. They engaged in trade while simultaneously smuggling opium into China. They found opium to be the most profitable trade. In 1836, of the 30,000 crates of opium that entered China through legal channels, 97% was controlled by Jewish drug trafficking syndicates. The Sassoon family held a 20% share in this drug trade. The Sassoons, led by David Sassoon, entered the opium trade with all eight of his sons. Later, after Lin Zexu‚Äôs efforts to confiscate and destroy opium, it was the opium trafficked by Jewish syndicates, with the Sassoon family as the leader, that Lin Zexu seized and destroyed. Upset by the confiscation of their opium, the Sassoon family joined forces with their Jewish relatives, the Rothschild family, to raise money to persuade the British Parliament to start the First Opium War, which ended in the victory of British and Jewish interests. After China‚Äôs defeat in the Opium War, the Sassoon family and their eight sons established the Sassoon and Sons trading house in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. They became heavily involved in opium trafficking in these areas, and David Sassoon eventually became the world‚Äôs largest drug lord. Many media outlets often praise the saying that Jewish children are raised on honeyed books, but they never mention that the wealth of Jewish families was originally built on usury and drug trafficking. In other countries, the behavior was the same. When Jewish refugees arrived in Palestine in 1947, they held banners proclaiming, ‚ÄúThe Germans destroyed our families and homes-don‚Äôt you destroy our hopes.‚Äù Over seventy years later, Palestinians are trapped in Gaza, living in what is essentially a prison. At the time of the Soviet Union‚Äôs dissolution, six out of seven oligarchs who divided up the country‚Äôs wealth were Jewish. Jews may tell you about how terribly they suffered at the hands of Hitler, but they never mention that at the time, the Jewish population in Germany was 560,000, making up only 1.5% of the total population. Yet, they controlled key sectors of the German economy and held approximately 1/16 of the nation‚Äôs economic wealth. Hitler, in ‚ÄúMein Kampf,‚Äù argued that Jewish people held an almost absolute sway over Germany‚Äôs economy, and this perception fueled his drive to eradicate them. The Jewish penchant for usury had always harmed their reputation. In fact, the social status of Jews before World War II was quite similar to the position of Chinese in Southeast Asia: they were good at making money, had no political status, often acted as white gloves for politicians, and would be blamed when things went wrong and were used as scapegoats. The periodic anti-Chinese pogroms in Southeast Asia were similar in nature to Hitler‚Äôs persecution of Jews. Jews are good at making money, and this enables them to invest heavily in elite education. Education is the key to success, as those who receive undergraduate education will naturally have a much higher success rate than those with only a middle school education. This investment in education has led to a surge of talent among Jews and their acquisition of 22% of Nobel Prizes, producing many top talents in various fields. We should applaud Jews for their commitment to education, but this doesn‚Äôt mean that ‚Äúanything is right when they have money.‚Äù Building one‚Äôs wealth through usury and drug trafficking is always highly disreputable. To claim that Jews are noble, kind, resilient, and wise, or to attribute them to a high-class ethnicity, is entirely unfounded. So, when it comes to lavishing praise on them, just remember that their success was built on usury and drug trafficking. Part FourAfter World War II, a large number of Jewish people fled to the United States, seeking refuge and tightly clinging to the American dream. They had learned from the horrors of the Holocaust and decided it was time for a major shift in their strategy. They expanded their influence beyond the realm of finance on Wall Street, realizing that controlling the media and culture were equally vital. With the help of individuals like Minow, whom I mentioned earlier, Jewish people who arrived in the United States from around the world solidified their control over some of the world‚Äôs most prestigious media conglomerates, film studios, record labels, and more. In the United Kingdom, the mainstream media is dominated by outlets like Reuters, the BBC, The Times, The Guardian, and The Telegraph. Reuters, founded in 1850, was established by Jews. The Times is associated with the Jewish Murdoch family, and while Murdoch‚Äôs Jewish heritage may not be entirely pure, he remains a prominent figure. The BBC was established with funding from several major consortiums, and The Daily Telegraph is owned by Canadian Conrad Black, whose Hollinger Inc. also controls the Chicago Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post, and more. The Guardian is currently owned by a foundation. In the United States, the situation is similar. For example, Joe Roth, the head of Disney Studios, is Jewish, and Time Warner‚Äôs former CEO, Gerald Levin, is Jewish. Their influence extends to ESPN, HBO, Warner Music, Time magazine, Sports Illustrated, People, Fortune, and more. Sumner Redstone, the owner of Viacom, is also Jewish. Their reach not only includes publishing houses but also extends to over four thousand Blockbuster video rental stores and media networks like Showtime and MTV. ABC Television is controlled by Jewish businessman Lawrence Tisch, while NBC is under the influence of Jewish businessman David Sarnoff. The New York Times is owned by the Jewish Sulzberger family, which also controls The Boston Globe, seven television stations, twelve magazines, three book publishing companies, and more. The Washington Post is owned by the Jewish Meyer family, and The Wall Street Journal is controlled by Jewish businessman Peter Kann. The founders of major Hollywood studios like Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount, MGM, Columbia, and 20th Century Fox were almost exclusively Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe and Russia. Even companies like Facebook and Twitter have Jewish connections. The majority of the world‚Äôs most prominent media organizations, which we often hear about, are under the control or influence of Jewish individuals and families. In the realm of ideas and culture, Jewish people also maintain a firm grip. In the universities on the East Coast of the United States, one-third of the professors are Jewish. In the fields of American literature, drama, and music, Jewish writers constitute 60% of the top talent. In the Washington and New York City metropolitan areas, 40% of law firm partners are Jewish. Many of the ideas and philosophies we encounter today were created by Jewish intellectuals. These ideas, once disseminated through the media they control, gradually influence the entire world and also deeply affect domestic populations. In films and literature, they extensively praise Jewish people. Consequently, teachers during my primary and secondary education would often stand at the front of the classroom and say, ‚ÄúJewish people are a suffering nation, a hardworking nation, a resilient nation.‚Äù They also suppress any criticism or dissent against Jewish people. Except in countries that still possess media sovereignty, like China, it has become politically incorrect to speak negatively of Jewish people, to doubt them, or even to discuss their identity. Jewish people, who had suffered so terribly during World War II, were able to regain a positive public image worldwide by gaining control over the finance, media, and culture of the United States. Part FiveToday, the relationship between Jewish people and the Chinese nation is generally one of tension and hostility. I use the term ‚Äúgenerally‚Äù because not all Jewish people are our enemies. We must respect the facts and avoid inciting hatred. Otherwise, we would be no different from Hitler. Some Jewish people do stand on our side, and the Jewish community is not a monolith; there are partners who engage in vibrant business relations with us. My questioning of Jewish people primarily stems from the fact that some Jewish individuals provoked us. As key players in American ideology, Jewish people have played the role of ideological vanguards and shock troops in suppressing China‚Äôs rise. In the current Biden administration, officials such as Secretary of State Blinken, White House Chief of Staff Klain, Treasury Secretary Yellen, Attorney General Garland, Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas, Director of National Intelligence Haines, Deputy Secretary of State Sherman, U.S. Science and Technology Advisor Lander, National Cyber Director Neuberger, CIA Deputy Director Cohen, and Assistant Secretary of Health Levine are all Jewish. By the way, in the recent history of the Federal Reserve in the United States, five out of the last six Chairmen have been Jewish. In the Biden administration, Jewish individuals hold key positions in foreign affairs, finance, justice, homeland security, national intelligence, technology, and more. They are deeply involved in almost every aspect. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has been increasingly pressuring China, from the COVID-19 pandemic to Xinjiang cotton. The initial attacks on China are often carried under the banner of Western moral righteousness, followed by a wave of propaganda against China. To say that Jewish people are good partners of the Chinese nation, I simply don‚Äôt believe it. While the Anglo-Saxon community has deployed aircraft carriers to the South China Sea to threaten China militarily, Jewish individuals have been working through media outlets like the BBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and others to smear and stigmatize China. They are brainwashing the Chinese people, imposing a form of spiritual colonization. Even when China is under such relentless attack, you are not allowed to say a word against Jewish people. If you do, you are branded as a nationalist, anti-human, or politically incorrect. But I‚Äôll still say it. Of course, there are some Jewish people who stand with us, and we need to clarify this relationship. We cannot generalize about Jewish people. Our views must be based on facts and guided by our interests. The primary purpose of writing this article today is to break the past superstitions about the Jewish people and inform everyone of the true nature of this community. In summary: Jewish people‚Äôs ability to earn money is a result of historical conditions and religious and ethnic struggles. After earning money, Jewish people have invested heavily in education, leading to a high success rate. We can learn from their achievements, but we should not idolize them. Since World War II, Jewish people have controlled the world‚Äôs top media outlets, using this as a vanguard to launch an ideological attack on China. We must maintain a clear mind, be decisive, and not be led by Jewish individuals. Jewish people excel in the fields of finance and media, as making money is the easiest in the finance sector, and the media serves as a cover, thus creating a multi-generational exploitation system. Jewish people in the financial sector are like leeches, and they are currently attached to the United States, with a high likelihood of attaching themselves to China in the future. We must be highly vigilant from the outset in the fields of finance and media and guard against Jewish individuals and their agents infiltrating China‚Äôs finance and media. While we don‚Äôt want to encourage hatred, some people have thrown dirty water at us, and sooner or later, the score will need to be settled.","link":"/Jews-hated-around-the-world/"},{"title":"Privacy Policy","text":"Privacy PolicyThis website respects and protects the personal privacy of all service users.

On October 7th, following a command from Hamas militants, 5,000 rockets were launched from the Gaza Strip towards Israel, while Hamas launched an attack on the Israeli Defense Forces from land, sea, and air. To be honest, this move caught Israel off guard. Israel lost 21 settlements in a row, several military camps, dozens of armored tanks were seized, and they even captured a brigadier general. Such a brilliant achievement, not even the former regional military powers like Egypt or Syria had ever achieved. However, Hamas has limited capabilities, and despite their successful surprise attack, they struggled to sustain their momentum. On the other hand, Israel is gearing up for a massive mobilization and has already called up 300,000 troops. If everything goes as expected, Israel is about to launch a large-scale counterattack against Hamas. So, what is the background of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and what is the underlying logic? 1. The Historical Origins of the Israel-Palestine ConflictThe core of the conflict between Israel and Palestine revolves around the question of who the land of Palestine belongs to. Israel claims unequivocally: ‚ÄúThis is the land of our ancestors!‚Äù To substantiate their claim, the Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, specifically took out a Bible and read it at the United Nations Security Council: ‚ÄúI will give to you and your descendants after you, the land where you are an alien, the whole land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.‚Äù (Genesis 17:8) Then, Danon held up the Bible and said, ‚ÄúThis is our title deed!‚Äù This statement may sound like it has a solid reasoning, but the problem is that the Bible is just a religious scripture, and it‚Äôs not a historical document! Actually, Jews first appeared in the Mesopotamian plain of Western Asia, and their ancestors were part of the ancient Semitic people. Later, to escape disasters, the Jews migrated to the eastern part of the Nile Delta, which is why they were called the Hebrews, meaning ‚Äúpeople who crossed over.‚Äù If the account in the Book of Exodus in the Bible is credible, these Jews were enslaved by the ancient Egyptians in the Nile region and, under the leadership of Abraham, they ‚Äúleft Egypt‚Äù and came to ‚ÄúCanaan‚Äù, where they established a kingdom. You see, even the Jews were newcomers at one point. So, were there indigenous people in the ‚ÄúCanaan‚Äù region? We don‚Äôt know. Therefore, even if Israel presents the Bible, it can‚Äôt prove that they are the indigenous people of this land. In the 1st century BC, the Roman Empire conquered the Jewish state, destroyed the Jerusalem Temple, and renamed the land ‚ÄúPalestine.‚Äù The Jews were expelled from Palestine, and the Jewish state of antiquity was thereby destroyed. In 638 AD, Arab forces occupied Jerusalem and introduced Islam. During Arab rule in Palestine, they continuously moved into the region and merged with the local indigenous population, forming the Arab population of Palestine, the Palestinians. Subsequently, this land was successively conquered by the Ottoman Empire and the British, and after World War I, it became a British mandate territory known as British-administered Palestine. You see, it was the Romans who destroyed the ancient Jewish state, not the Palestinians. Anti-Semitism was proposed by Europeans, not Palestinians. Nazi Germany‚Äôs genocide of Jews was not carried out by Palestinians. So, what does the historical suffering of the Jewish people have to do with the current Palestinian population? Palestinians gradually formed 700 years after the fall of the ancient Jewish state, and it can‚Äôt be said that they ‚Äústole land from Jews.‚Äù However, due to the widespread anti-Semitism in Europe in the 19th century, the ideology and movement of Jewish Zionism emerged. Countless Jews began to think that their continuous wandering was not a solution and that they needed to establish their own state. But all the land in Europe was already claimed. Where could they establish their nation? Thinking that their ancestors once established a state in the ‚ÄúCanaan‚Äù region, they decided to settle there. So, under the guidance of the ‚ÄúJewish return movement,‚Äù a large number of Jews moved to Palestine and established more than 300 settlements there. But the land had been inhabited by Palestinians for over a thousand years; you can‚Äôt just claim it as your own because your ancestors lived there. As a result, there was constant bloodshed between Jews and the indigenous Palestinian people. After World War II, the United Nations was established to address some of the world‚Äôs most complex issues. On April 28, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly held a special committee meeting to specifically discuss the Palestine issue. At that time, Jews had significant influence in both the UK and the US, especially in the financial sector, controlling the resources of Western countries. So, under the initiative of the UK and the US, the United Nations passed Resolution 181, which agreed to the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. So, what about the Palestinians living on this land? No worries, just set aside a piece of land for them. Therefore, the resolution stipulated that in 1948, the British mandate rule would end in the Palestinian region, and Jews would establish Israel (about 11,000 square miles), and Palestinians would establish Palestine (about 8,600 square miles). However, the surrounding Arab countries strongly opposed this. Why should we give land to newcomers just because of a UN resolution? So, on May 14, 1948, after Israel was established, the next day, neighboring Arab countries declared war on Israel. As a result, the Arab countries performed poorly in the war and were defeated. In the following decades, there were four more wars between Arab countries and Israel, and each of them concluded with Israel‚Äôs victory. During each of these wars, Israel‚Äôs territory expanded, and the entire Palestinian region, including the area designated for the Palestinian state, came under Israeli control. After occupying the Palestinian territory, Israel began to build Jewish settlements with its strong military power, gradually encroaching on Palestinian land. Up to the present day, Israel has taken over more than 70% of Palestinian land, leaving Palestine with only the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank. Although in 1967, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 242, demanding Israel‚Äôs withdrawal from the occupied territories and the dismantling of settlements, Israel refused to comply. However, the prolonged conflict also caused significant internal damage to Israel. Simultaneously, the occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank led to Palestinian resentment, resulting in sporadic suicide bombings and other attacks, keeping Israel on edge. In 2002, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon came up with a new plan. Instead of pursuing further occupation of Palestinian territories, he unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Then, Israel constructed a separation wall around Gaza to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian separation, with the aim of completely resolving the issue of attacks. So, the nightmare for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip began, where they have essentially lived in a large prison from birth. It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to call it a prison. In the air, Israel destroyed the only airport in the Gaza Strip, cutting off air traffic. On the ground, Israel constructed a wall around Gaza that stretches for tens of kilometers and reaches heights of more than ten meters. The wall is equipped with searchlights and guard towers at regular intervals, with machine guns mounted on them. Within a 300-meter range of the separation wall is a buffer zone, and anyone, whether an adult or a child, who enters this zone is subject to being shot on sight. Even Trump would acknowledge the expertise of such measures. At sea, Israel imposed a blockade, allowing Gaza fishermen to fish only up to 4.8 kilometers from the shore. If they go beyond that limit, they face gunfire. As a result, all land, sea, and air traffic to and from the Gaza Strip has been cut off, and the 3 million people living there are squeezed into this narrow area, which is 40 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide. Imagine how desperate life is for the people there, as they can‚Äôt leave for their entire lives. What‚Äôs even more unreasonable is that after Israel built the wall, they initiated an embargo on goods going into Gaza. Apart from strictly limited food and water, no other materials, such as building supplies, medicines, cement, pipes, electronics, and more, are allowed to enter. Can you imagine that in the Gaza Strip, a child playing soccer and accidentally entering the buffer zone would be mercilessly killed? Can you imagine that Gaza fishermen, just going out to sea to catch fish, would be sunk by Israeli warships? Can you imagine that water tanks on the rooftops of Gaza residents‚Äô homes would be riddled with dozens of bullet holes just because Israeli soldiers were bored? Can you imagine that when a baby in Gaza has a fever, Israel doesn‚Äôt allow fever-reducing medicine to enter? It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that there is a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip almost every day. However, wherever there is oppression, there is resistance. Israel‚Äôs blockade and oppression in the Gaza Strip have given rise to the Palestinian Islamic resistance movement (Hamas). The Gaza Strip was originally ruled by the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), but after Fatah signed a reconciliation ‚ÄúOslo Agreement‚Äù with Israel, it not only became submissive to Israel but also began sending Palestinians to work in Israel as a means to earn intermediary fees, which increasingly caused resentment among the residents of the Gaza Strip. In 2007, Fatah and Hamas erupted in a fierce internal conflict in the Gaza Strip, ultimately leading to Hamas driving Fatah out of the Gaza Strip. So, the current Palestinian authority actually has two parts: Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Hamas‚Äôs manifesto is not recognizing Israel and aiming to recapture the entire Palestinian territory, so they have been active in recent years. They have dug numerous tunnels from the Gaza Strip to Egypt, bypassing Israel‚Äôs separation wall, to smuggle various necessary supplies, especially weapons and ammunition. With weapons and ammunition, Hamas began launching frequent attacks on Israel and occasionally firing rockets at Israel. Originally, both sides were accustomed to this tit-for-tat, but on October 4th, a sudden incident ignited a spark. On that day, several hundred Israelis, under the protection of Israeli police, entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque and caused a commotion. This angered Hamas. You see, the Al-Aqsa Mosque is located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, which Muslims call the ‚ÄúNoble Sanctuary.‚Äù It is the third holiest site in Islam, following the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and the Prophet‚Äôs Mosque in Medina. Now, with Israelis barging in, it‚Äôs a blatant insult! So, on October 7th, Hamas launched a large-scale attack code-named ‚ÄúAqsa Flood,‚Äù launching a comprehensive assault on Israel from land, sea, and air. This marks the most serious Israeli-Palestinian conflict in fifty years. 2. Behind the Israeli-Palestinian ConflictOn the surface, this Israeli-Palestinian conflict may appear as a desperate resistance by the Palestinians against long-term Israeli oppression. However, fundamentally, this conflict is still a power struggle among major nations. First, it‚Äôs a spillover from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been ongoing for a year and a half, with NATO continuously escalating its actions and challenging Russia‚Äôs bottom line, this war has increasingly begun to affect the world and carry the risk of spillover. This spillover has both passive and active factors. The passive factors are that major powers have their attention diverted, allowing smaller countries to exploit the situation. As we know, the world is full of conflicts today, ranging from geopolitical disputes, border clashes, and ethnic tensions to resource conflicts, energy disputes, environmental concerns, and economic disputes, among others. In short, any of these conflicts can trigger a war. Before World War II, the world was in a constant state of war and conflict. However, after World War II, the nations of the world, fearing the devastating consequences of a global war, established the United Nations and other mechanisms to maintain peace. Conflicts around the world significantly decreased. Is the United Nations mechanism really effective? On the surface, it may seem so, but in reality, it‚Äôs the influence of major world powers that plays the key role. The United States, at the zenith of its power, and the Soviet Union had considerable clout. In their respective spheres of influence, whenever they spoke, most small countries had to consider their words carefully. This was even more pronounced after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. If the United States didn‚Äôt want a war to continue, a single word from them could usually bring a swift resolution, and those that didn‚Äôt comply, like Saddam, faced the consequences. This state was referred to as the ‚ÄúU.S.-led global order‚Äù or ‚Äúoffshore balancing.‚Äù However, the situation has changed now. On one hand, the United States is heavily focused on dealing with China in economic, political, and military realms. This has led to a massive redeployment of its resources. The U.S. even withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving a power vacuum in other regions. On the other hand, the United States is stoking the Russia-Ukraine war, providing a considerable amount of money and military aid to Ukraine, which naturally leaves fewer resources for other areas. Consequently, America‚Äôs control over the globe has diminished. Some small countries that have conflicts with neighboring nations but were previously restrained by U.S. influence see this as a ‚Äústrategic opportunity.‚Äù They think that the U.S. is too preoccupied with countering China and Russia to meddle in their affairs. As long as they act swiftly, the U.S. will have no choice but to accept the status quo. Hence, in recent years, we‚Äôve seen conflicts escalating worldwide. It began with the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, followed by the Kosovo conflict, and then the large-scale civil war in Libya. Even Argentina has been talking about retaking the Falkland Islands. From this perspective, the new round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict is rooted in the irreconcilable differences between Israel and Palestine. Secondly, it‚Äôs a consequence of the power struggle between China and the United States in the Middle East. Currently, China and the United States are engaged in fierce competition in various domains, and diplomacy is no exception. The most intense rivalry between the two superpowers is not just in Southeast Asia; it‚Äôs in the Middle East. However, China and the United States employ different strategies in the Middle East. After Saudi Arabia and Iran achieved a historic reconciliation mediated by China, the United States felt a significant shock. It has repeatedly claimed that China‚Äôs influence has penetrated the Middle East and that the United States is falling behind. Consequently, the Biden administration has taken a series of actions in the Middle East with the aim of reasserting American influence in the region. Recently, the United States has been pushing for the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal on August 9, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are working on an agreement to pave the way for the normalization of Saudi-Israeli relations. Under this agreement, Saudi Arabia would recognize Israel and establish diplomatic ties. In exchange, Israel would make concessions on the Palestinian issue. Saudi Arabia would receive security guarantees and civil nuclear assistance from the U.S. Additionally, as a reciprocal gesture, Saudi Arabia may increase its oil production, which could help reduce U.S. inflation, benefiting Biden‚Äôs political prospects. In this negotiation process between Saudi Arabia and the United States, the plight of the Palestinian people is essentially just a bargaining chip. In other words, if the United States offers conditions that satisfy Saudi Arabia, then the Palestinian cause is likely to be sacrificed. This development has significant implications for the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia is a major Sunni power in the Islamic world. If Saudi Arabia reconciles with Israel, it could set a precedent for other Islamic countries in the Middle East to do the same. For Palestinians who have suffered from Israeli humanitarian crises for decades, this means an even bleaker future with fewer hopes of stability. It implies that the Palestinians could become more isolated within the Islamic world. From this perspective, the Palestinians are determined to prevent the successful normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 3 The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has caused significant trouble for the United StatesFrom the current situation, there is a significant possibility that Israel will seize this opportunity during the ongoing attacks, potentially even considering a full-scale assault on Gaza. After all, airstrikes and blockades alone won‚Äôt quell Israeli public anger, nor will they completely eliminate the threat posed by Hamas. Netanyahu‚Äôs already precarious approval ratings are on the line. If he doesn‚Äôt capitalize on this opportunity with a tough stance to gain popular support, his political future in Israel may be in jeopardy. However, if Israel escalates its actions, it could bring significant trouble to the United States. First, it would divert U.S. attentionIn essence, Israel undoubtedly aims to solve the Gaza issue once and for all, as this place has become a festering sore. Palestinians suffer, and Israelis also suffer because it‚Äôs not reasonable to have to act like thieves every day; there should be a way to put an end to it. As long as Gaza remains, generation after generation of Palestinian children receive anti-Israel education from a young age. Even if Hamas were eliminated, new generations of Hamas would emerge, and the threat to Israel would continue endlessly. However, the issue is that it‚Äôs not 100 years ago! If both sides are stuck in the urban warfare of Gaza, and Israel can‚Äôt distinguish between Hamas militants and civilians, civilian casualties on a large scale are inevitable. At that time, forget about UN intervention, even the neighboring Arab countries would likely remain passive. In these days, Arab countries are urgently coordinating. Iranian President Raisi talked to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the phone to discuss the Gaza situation, emphasizing the necessity to prevent Israel from committing war crimes against the Palestinians. It‚Äôs worth noting that this is the first national leader communication between Saudi Arabia and Iran after their reconciliation. Hezbollah in Lebanon has also begun firing rockets and shells towards Israeli positions to show support. The 7th Division of the Syrian Army and one of the three elite units, the 4th Mechanized Division, are heading to the southern Daraa region, posing a threat to the Golan Heights. With such public sentiment, if Israel launches a large-scale attack on Gaza, resulting in the deaths and injuries of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, there is no doubt that it will inflame the Arab world with immense anger. At this point, even if Saudi Arabia maintains an ambiguous stance, it must take a position. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself faces significant internal opposition and would not dare to bear the accusation of ‚Äúbetraying the Arab world‚Äù again. In the event of further deterioration, it is not inconceivable that the blood of the Palestinian people could become the adhesive binding the Arab world, prompting them to form another coalition against Israel and possibly triggering the sixth Middle East war. In this situation, the United States finds itself in a dilemma. If they persuade Israel not to retaliate on a large scale and not to invade Gaza, will Israel, already in a heated state, listen? After all, the last Israeli leader who compromised under American guidance, Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated by Israeli extremists. It is clear that Netanyahu would not want to follow in Rabin‚Äôs footsteps. If the U.S. supports Israel, they would have to move military forces to the Middle East to deter Arab countries from taking reckless actions. Currently, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, has ordered the deployment of the United States‚Äô largest and most advanced aircraft carrier strike group, the USS Gerald R. Ford, to the eastern Mediterranean. Additionally, another U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, set sail on the 13th for deployment near Israel. However, in doing so, doesn‚Äôt this mean that Biden‚Äôs strategy to withdraw from the Middle East to counter China has been rendered almost pointless? So, regardless of whether this event was orchestrated by Iran to disrupt the Saudi-Israeli reconciliation, it has objectively served to divert U.S. attention and reduce the pressure from China. The second aspect is to disrupt the United States‚Äô strategy with its allies.As we all know, in the past, the United States was the world‚Äôs superpower, and it could essentially do as it pleased in international conflicts. It often didn‚Äôt have to fear taking on multiple opponents. However, in recent years, with the decline of U.S. power, the United States has had to rely more on its allies to bolster its strategic stability. If we look at recent geopolitical contests between China and the United States, as well as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the first thing the United States has done is to form coalitions, rallying other nations and seeking a sense of ‚Äúrighteousness‚Äù through this united front. After the recent Hamas attacks, the United States is no exception. It has once again started organizing a coalition. President Biden has stated that U.S. support for Israel is rock-solid, and French President Macron has expressed solidarity with Israel. Subsequently, many Western countries, including the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and others, have mostly condemned Hamas. Even India, which has sometimes had differing positions from the U.S., has clearly expressed its support for Israel. In the Arab world, most countries support Palestine, with a few refraining from making a statement. Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately made phone calls to the foreign ministers of Middle Eastern countries, urging them to make public statements supporting Israel. It is likely that the Arab nations who received these phone calls were not pleased. It‚Äôs important to note that while some Middle Eastern countries have private dealings with Israel, **there is no country in the region that openly takes Israel‚Äôs side in the Israel-Palestine conflict. ** Why? Because in the Israel-Palestine conflict, supporting Palestine and opposing Israel not only enjoys broad public support in Muslim countries but is also the prevailing political correctness. Perhaps the United States realized that Middle Eastern countries were not buying into their stance, so they turned to their quasi-ally, Saudi Arabia, hoping that if Saudi Arabia took a stance, other countries would follow suit. So, Secretary of State Blinken personally visited Saudi Arabia to urge them to exert pressure on Hamas. However, how could Saudi Arabia openly side with Israel when it goes against domestic public opinion and the most significant political correctness in the Muslim world? Thus, under Blinken‚Äôs pressure, Saudi Arabia had no choice but to make a public statement supporting Palestine and announced the postponement of negotiations concerning the normalization of relations with Israel that the United States had been promoting. You see, Saudi Arabia initially wanted to quietly sit on the fence, but due to Blinken‚Äôs pressure, they had to take a public stance in support of Palestine. Moreover, after taking sides, they called the Iranian President to discuss the Israel-Palestine conflict. An advisor to Iran‚Äôs President, Jamsheed, later revealed, ‚ÄúDuring the 45-minute conversation, they emphasized Islamic unity and believed that the crimes of the Zionist regime and U.S. complicity were the reasons for the destructive insecurity.‚Äù After Saudi Arabia‚Äôs declaration, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and even Pakistan‚Äôs Chief of Army Staff announced their support for the Palestinian people. The Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan declared, ‚ÄúIf Israel launches a ground operation in Gaza, we will provide ballistic missile support to Palestine.‚Äù Considering that Pakistan has long been a key player for Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as Saudi Arabia drawing a red line through Pakistan to Israel: ‚ÄúYou can bomb, but you can‚Äôt enter Gaza on the ground!‚Äù From the perspective of Blinken, who has been laboring hard to rally support, this display of Arab solidarity is nothing less than a public humiliation. This fully illustrates that Blinken‚Äôs pressure tactics are not well-received. What is the core of diplomatic work? It is about finding common ground amid differences and discovering channels that both sides can accept to carry out diplomatic activities. But what about Blinken? He has always been an ideologue who prefers to talk to others from a standpoint of ‚Äústarting with the strength of the United States.‚Äù To cater to the domestic political climate that supports Israel, Blinken began globetrotting to gain political achievements, but the results turned out to be counterproductive. If it‚Äôs just Blinken losing face himself, that‚Äôs a minor issue. However, if it leads to alienation of U.S. allies and undermines the U.S. ally strategy, then it becomes a major problem. The third factor is forcing the United States to seek cooperation with China.On October 7th, a delegation from the United States Senate visited China, bringing new opportunities for improved U.S.-China relations. On the one hand, the Biden administration, including Blinken and Sullivan, faces the challenge that any concessions to China could lead to political attacks that affect the Democratic Party‚Äôs electoral prospects. Therefore, having Senate Majority Leaders with a more detached stance allows for greater flexibility. On the other hand, the visiting senators were mostly elected at the local government level, representing the interests of certain states, and have a broader basis for cooperation with China. In the past, due to significant differences on various issues, U.S.-China cooperation was primarily limited to climate cooperation and combating drug-related matters. However, this visit included discussions on bilateral trade and investment, as well as resolving regional conflicts. What regional conflicts need to be addressed? Primarily the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and now, adding the Israel-Palestine conflict to the mix. This clearly demonstrates that the United States, even if unwilling, must acknowledge that it needs to cooperate with China to address regional conflicts. If the United States does not want its global strategy and regional balance to be thrown into chaos by major international developments, it must seek cooperation with China. China has consistently coordinated its position with various countries, advocating for peace and negotiations. China has sided with the Palestinian people, which aligns with its consistent stance against bullying the weak with strength. Currently, it is uncertain whether U.S. mediation will be effective, but this situation has shown that in the face of an increasingly complex international situation, severe Democratic Party electoral conditions, and worsening domestic economic difficulties, the United States will have to work with China to address certain issues. Therefore, the Israel-Palestine conflict should not be viewed solely from the perspective of the Israelis and Palestinians; it conceals complex geopolitical maneuvering. The next step is highly likely to involve Israeli retaliatory actions. The extent of this retaliation and whether it might trigger Arab world coalition intervention, as well as any new actions by China, the United States, and Russia, remain unknown. The only certainty is that since the launch of Hamas rockets, we have entered a more chaotic world.","link":"/palestine-rsrael-conflict/"},{"title":"Taiwan and the True Sources of Deterrence","text":"Why America Must Reassure, Not Just Threaten, ChinaBy Bonnie S. Glaser, Jessica Chen Weiss, and Thomas J. ChristensenThis article is reproduced from American Think Tank Magazine„ÄäFOREIGN AFFAIRS„Äã The growing might of China‚Äôs military and its increasingly aggressive posture toward Taiwan have made deterrence in the Taiwan Strait a tougher challenge than ever before. It is incumbent on the United States to support Taiwan‚Äôs efforts to develop a defensive ‚Äúporcupine strategy.‚Äù Washington can help Taiwan‚Äôs military stockpile and train with coastal defense and air defense weapons, field a robust civil defense force, and create strategic reserves of critical materials such as food and fuel to deter and, if necessary, defeat an invasion or blockade of the island. The U.S. military should also better prepare to cope with China‚Äôs expanding arsenal of missiles that pose a threat to U.S. regional bases and even aircraft carriers by creating a stronger, more agile, and more geographically dispersed military presence in the region. But deterrence is not just a matter of weapons in arsenals, boots on the ground, planes in the air, ships at sea, or strategies on the planning table. Signaling a credible military threat is only part of a successful strategy of deterrence. It also takes assurances to keep potential adversaries at bay. A threatened state has little incentive to avoid war if it fears the unacceptable consequences of not fighting. As the Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist Thomas Schelling wrote years ago, ‚Äú‚ÄòOne more step and I shoot‚Äô can be a deterrent threat only if accompanied by the implicit assurance, ‚ÄòAnd if you stop, I won‚Äôt.‚Äô‚Äù In truth, the more powerful and credible one‚Äôs threat of military action, the more important and the more difficult it is to credibly assure the potential adversary. The three parties involved in the Taiwan Strait are not providing one another with sufficient assurances. For example, to enhance deterrence, Washington must make clear that it opposes any unilateral change to the status quo, not only an attempt by Beijing to compel unification but also a political move by Taipei to pursue independence. And as the United States works with Taiwan to strengthen its security, it must avoid giving the impression that it is moving toward restoring formal diplomatic relations or a defense alliance with the island. Combined with a conditional and credible threat of a military response by the United States and Taiwan to the use of force, such assurances will help prevent a war. Ill-advised statements made in the past by former and current U.S. officials suggesting that the United States should formally recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state or restore a clear alliance commitment to defend the island would, if adopted, undercut assurances and weaken deterrence as surely as would a lack of military readiness. U.S. military threats will lose their potency if Chinese leaders believe that the United States will take advantage of their restraint to promote Taiwan‚Äôs formal independence or to prevent unification under any circumstances, even if it were to result from peaceful, uncoerced negotiation. Beijing may determine that refraining from an attack would mean it would forever lose the possibility of unification or would allow the United States to restore something akin to a defense alliance with Taiwan. And if China comes to that conclusion, then Washington‚Äôs focus on beefing up military power in the region may still fail to prevent a war. DAMNED IF THEY DO, DAMNED IF THEY DON‚ÄôTAlthough the logic of deterrence through brute strength is intuitively appealing, both theory and history show that the threat of punishment fails to deter if it is not paired with assurances that those same military capabilities will not be used to in some way hurt the other side. ‚ÄúThe purpose of combining conditional assurances with conditional threats,‚Äù the political scientist Reid Pauly has noted, is to ‚Äúpresent a choice; one that does not lead the target to believe they are ‚Äòdamned if they do, and damned if they don‚Äôt.‚Äô‚Äù For effective deterrence, both threats and assurances must be credible. As the scholars Matthew Cebul, Allan Dafoe, and Nuno Monteiro have noted, ‚ÄúPower boosts the credibility of threats but undermines that of assurances.‚Äù This dynamic is what political scientists have long described as the security dilemma. To issue credible threats and assurances simultaneously, leaders must cultivate ‚Äúa reputation for restraint in the face of compliance‚Äù rather than simply a reputation for unconditionally inflicting punishment. And it is precisely because the United States should bolster and diversify its military presence in the region and help strengthen Taiwan‚Äôs defenses that it must also provide clearer and more persistently conveyed assurances. Beijing, Taipei, and Washington are all focused on demonstrating resolve and building convincing wartime capabilities to signal their preparedness and willingness to use force. Beijing hopes to prevent Taiwan from further consolidating its separation from the mainland, while Taipei and Washington hope to deter Beijing from attacking Taiwan to force unification. Yet all three parties have neglected corresponding efforts to signal to one another that these military preparations are not meant to alter the status quo or to preclude the prospect of an eventual peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences. To be sure, leaders on all sides have, to some extent, continued to offer assurances to one another. Senior&nbsp;Biden administration&nbsp;officials have reaffirmed that the United States does not support Taiwan‚Äôs independence; Chinese leaders have reiterated that ‚Äúpeaceful reunification‚Äù remains their preferred option (although they tend to regard coercive efforts, short of war, as still peaceful); and leaders in Taipei have refrained from pushing for formal independence. Unfortunately, officials in all three capitals have also expanded the scope of what they believe are legitimate measures to signal resolve in response to perceived threats, fueling a potentially dangerous spiral of actions and reactions. Beijing, Taipei, and Washington have not reiterated key statements that once made an eventual peaceful resolution at least conceivable. Such assurances were never meant to promote a near-term resolution or to specify the details of any eventual resolution; they were meant to convey that there still might be peaceful ways of settling cross-strait differences. For instance, Beijing‚Äôs proposals regarding the governance of a future Taiwan unified with the mainland have grown less generous over time. The ‚Äúone country, two systems‚Äù offer that Beijing made in a 1993 white paper included allowing the island to ‚Äúhave its own administrative and legislative powers, an independent judiciary, and the right of adjudication‚Äù as well as ‚Äúits own party, political, military, economic, and financial affairs,‚Äù and a pledge that Beijing would not send troops or administrative personnel to be stationed in Taiwan. The former assurance disappeared in China‚Äôs 2000 white paper on the topic, and the latter was removed in its 2022 iteration. ‚ÄúOne country, two systems‚Äù was never a popular concept in Taiwan, and it has become even less so now that Beijing has tightened its hold on Hong Kong, where it had pioneered the approach. Combined with increasingly aggressive and frequent Chinese military operations near Taiwan, the failure to offer more attractive options for Taiwan‚Äôs future only makes Beijing seem both more threatening and less trustworthy. Military threats alone may fail to prevent a war over Taiwan. As for Taiwan, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has a long tradition of supporting independence, but since 1999 it has ceased calling for the creation of a Republic of Taiwan and instead maintains that Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China, is already an independent sovereign state. The current DPP president, Tsai Ing-wen, has refrained from seeking formal independence and has sought to alleviate Beijing‚Äôs worst fears, adhering to her 2016 pledge to act in accordance with the Republic of China‚Äôs constitution, which defines China as including both sides of the strait. At the same time, she has refused to accept the ‚Äú1992 Consensus,‚Äù an alleged understanding between representatives of Beijing and the KMT (Kuomintang, the Chinese Nationalist Party) that mainland China and Taiwan belong to one and the same country even as they disagreed about whether that country was the Republic of China or the People‚Äôs Republic of China. DPP members and many scholars dispute that such a consensus ever existed. Still, Beijing accuses Tsai of altering the status quo by failing to accept the 1992 consensus, which her rivals in the KMT continue to endorse. And although she has resisted pressure from radicals in her own party to pursue measures that would likely be interpreted in Beijing as moves in the direction of independence‚Äîsuch as ceasing to use the Republic of&nbsp;China&nbsp;national anthem or insisting on the use of the moniker ‚ÄúTaiwan‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúChinese Taipei‚Äù at international sporting events‚ÄîTsai has allowed the teaching of Taiwan‚Äôs history separate from the history of China in high schools. And questions remain about the sustainability of Taiwan‚Äôs restraint in the future. The current DPP vice president and front-runner in the presidential election scheduled for January 13, 2024, Lai Ching-te, has in the past advocated for independence more stridently than Tsai, describing himself in 2017 as a ‚Äúpolitical worker for Taiwan independence.‚Äù More recently in July 2023, Lai told supporters at a campaign event that his party‚Äôs ambition is to have a sitting president of Taiwan ‚Äúenter the White House,‚Äù which implies his goal is to upgrade Taiwan‚Äôs relationship with the United States, raising alarm in Beijing and prompting a request for clarification from Washington. As for the United States, the Biden administration has regularly reiterated that it ‚Äúdoes not support Taiwan independence‚Äù and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo by either side. These statements are consistent with the traditional U.S. policy of ‚Äústrategic ambiguity‚Äù in which the United States avoids specifying under what conditions it would intervene in a cross-strait conflict and thereby does not give a green light to independence advocates in Taiwan or provoke Beijing by appearing to restore the U.S. alliance commitment to Taiwan. But the credibility of those statements has been called into question by Biden‚Äôs repeated insistence that the United States would come to Taiwan‚Äôs defense if attacked because it made a commitment to do so, even though the United States has not had a formal obligation to defend Taiwan since it abrogated the alliance with Taipei in 1979 as a precondition to normalizing diplomatic relations with Beijing. Biden administration officials have also noticeably failed to confirm that the United States would accept any peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences achieved through negotiations and without coercion. The Biden administration‚Äôs omission of this assurance has increased Beijing‚Äôs suspicions that Washington would never accept any form of cross-strait integration, even if achieved through nonviolent means. So have statements by Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific affairs, that Taiwan is ‚Äúlocated at a critical node within the First Island Chain‚Äù in the Western Pacific, implying that the island is strategically indispensable to the defense of U.S. allies and thus no form of unification would be acceptable to the United States. Chinese officials no doubt perceive Washington‚Äôs efforts to strengthen ties with Taiwan and pursue a stronger military posture in the region as a serious demonstration of resolve. But U.S. actions, paired with the rhetoric of American officials, have also raised fears in Beijing that the United States seeks to ‚Äúuse Taiwan to contain China,‚Äù as China‚Äôs State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi charged at a press conference in August 2022, and to restore something akin to the alliance that existed with Taipei before 1979. Some analysts in Beijing fear that recent U.S. attempts to reopen high-level diplomatic channels with Beijing merely mask continued efforts to weaken China and prevent even peaceful unification from ever occurring. Such fears are exacerbated by statements by members of the U.S. Congress, former senior officials, and leading scholars who call for everything from restoring official relations with Taiwan to resurrecting the U.S. alliance with it to stationing large numbers of U.S. forces on the island. DOUBTS AND FEARS IN THE STRAITTo shore up peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, all sides must recognize that credible assurance is essential for effective deterrence. Credible assurance is not a reward or a carrot. It is a guarantee that a threat is fully conditional on the behavior of its target. Such assurances are not the same as trust-building measures, which are incremental compromises made in a gradual and reciprocal manner. By contrast, an assurance does not have to be reciprocated, as it is not a concession or an effort to build trust. It can and should be made unilaterally to strengthen deterrence, as long as it does not weaken the credibility or capacity to respond to perceived threats. On its own, a credible assurance would strengthen deterrence. If reciprocated, it could, over time, build trust among the parties and reduce tensions. Beijing has long threatened to adopt ‚Äúnonpeaceful‚Äù means if Taipei appears to be pursuing permanent separation or formal independence. But the Chinese military buildup and intense military drills near Taiwan have fueled fears that Beijing is shifting from a policy of deterring any pursuit of independence by Taiwan to compelling unification through coercion or military force. As these doubts and suspicions multiply, all sides will lose the incentive to avoid provocative moves. When Beijing fails to reassure Taipei that its military preparations are not a harbinger of a coming attack, it undercuts incentives for people in Taiwan to support moderation by its political leaders. The lack of credible Chinese assurances also strengthens the hand of American politicians and commentators who want to scrap strategic ambiguity, upgrade ties with Taiwan from unofficial to official relations, and restore defense commitments to the island akin to those that obtained before 1979. To strengthen the credibility of Beijing‚Äôs commitment to a peaceful process, China should dial back its military operations near Taiwan. Having used such operations to register displeasure with U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs visit to Taiwan in August 2022, Chinese air and naval exercises should be reset to the two-decade practice of tacitly observing the Taiwan Strait centerline. Beijing also codified into a 2005 law its right to use force against Taiwan if it perceives that peaceful unification is no longer possible. The vague conditions and implied impatience of such a threat have failed to convince people in Taiwan that the island will not be attacked as long as they do not attempt to permanently separate from China. Without such an assurance, Taipei has less reason to refrain from pursuing unilateral changes in the status quo. China should revise this language to incorporate the assurance that as long as Taiwan does not pursue formal independence, Beijing will not use force. If Beijing‚Äôs leaders truly prefer peaceful unification with Taiwan, as they continue to claim, they should keep the door open to precisely that outcome. Biden and Xi in Woodside, California, November 2023 For its part, Taiwan must accompany needed measures to bolster its defense with credible assurances to Beijing that as long as the Chinese military refrains from attacking Taiwan, Taipei will not pursue independence or permanent separation. Taiwan should refrain from potentially provocative actions, such as holding a referendum to change its official name, the Republic of China, or revising its territorial claims to exclude mainland China‚Äîchanges that would indicate a declaration of formal independence. Regardless of who is elected Taiwan‚Äôs next president, Taipei will need to convincingly reassure Beijing that it has no intention of fundamentally altering the status quo. But the need for such guarantees will grow in the event of the victory of Lai, the DPP candidate; Chinese officials deeply mistrust him since he has endorsed the pursuit of formal independence for Taiwan in the past. The pledge that Lai made, in an October 2023 speech in Taipei at a dinner attended by nearly 100 foreign dignitaries and guests, to maintain Tsai‚Äôs cross-strait policy, with its emphasis on refusing both to bow to Chinese pressure and to provoke Beijing, is a good start. If elected, Lai could use his inaugural address to reaffirm the commitments Tsai made in her inaugural speech in 2016 to conduct cross-strait affairs in accordance with the Republic of China‚Äôs constitution and the 1992 act governing relations between the two sides of the strait, Taipei‚Äôs law on how the island should manage relations with Beijing. As Taiwan strengthens its military deterrent‚Äîincluding by increasing its ability to withstand a blockade and to defeat an invading Chinese force‚Äîit must also implement additional measures to reinforce the credibility of its assurances. In August, Lai took a step in the right direction when he made his stance on the naming question clear: ‚ÄúPresident Tsai has used the term Republic of China (Taiwan) to describe our country. I will continue to do so in the future.‚Äù This and other statements provide China with rhetorical assurance, but because his party‚Äôs 1991 charter still calls for the creation of a ‚ÄúRepublic of Taiwan‚Äù and a new constitution, doubts persist in Beijing about his willingness to hold to this position as president. If he wins the election, Lai should consider revisiting a proposal made by DPP legislators in 2014 to suspend the independence clause in the 1991 party charter, a nonbinding and reversible step that would give any rhetorical commitment to the status quo more weight and credibility. Such a step could also be part of a gradual, reciprocal process to reduce tensions and build trust, as advocated by Richard Bush, the former chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan. Just as the United States must not rule out the possibility of an eventual peaceful integration of the two sides of the strait (as long as such a move has the assent of the people of Taiwan), Taipei should also not take actions that would permanently foreclose that outcome. To deter war, Taiwan must allow leaders in Beijing to believe that peaceful unification remains possible. DISCRETION AND DISCIPLINEAs the third party to this dispute, the United States must also think carefully about its mix of threats and assurances. Its priority is to prevent the Chinese military from attacking Taiwan, but deterrence will not work if Beijing does not believe U.S. assurances. For instance, it is in the United States‚Äô interest for China to remain hopeful that sometime in the future it might be able to resolve its differences with Taiwan without resorting to violence. China would have to persuade Taiwan‚Äôs public of the merits of some form of peaceful integration‚Äîa hard sell, but not impossible given China‚Äôs economic clout and the possibility that a more attractive government may someday emerge in Beijing. To the extent that Washington can influence Chinese President Xi Jinping‚Äôs thinking on this crucial issue, it should do so; the United States should avoid making statements or taking actions that could lead Beijing to conclude that unification can only be achieved through force. Consistent with its ‚Äúone China‚Äù policy of not supporting an independent Taiwan or seeking to restore a formal alliance with Taipei, the U.S. government should not use in its official communications symbols of Taiwan‚Äôs sovereignty, such as the flag of the Republic of China, or refer to Taiwan as either a country or an ally, as the Trump administration did in a 2019 Defense Department report. If U.S. officials do so inadvertently, such as when U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken referred to Taiwan as a country on two occasions in 2021, a correction should be swiftly issued. An example of the laudable handling of such a blunder was the White House‚Äôs admission that it made an ‚Äúhonest mistake‚Äù after including the image of the Republic of China flag in a tweet about the United States supplying COVID-19 vaccines to Taiwan that same year. And since Beijing fears that Taiwan may merely be a pawn in a wider American game of containment, U.S. officials should not imply that Taiwan is a strategic asset essential to U.S. national security. The Biden administration insists that it has made no changes to the ‚Äúone China‚Äù policy. But Biden‚Äôs remarks have repeatedly broken with strategic ambiguity and mischaracterized U.S. policy. During an August 2021 interview with ABC News, Biden stated, incorrectly, that the United States has a treaty commitment to defend Taiwan, comparing the U.S. ‚Äúsacred commitment‚Äù to the pledges it has made to Japan and South Korea. In the most egregious misstatement of U.S. policy on Taiwan to date, Biden told reporters in November 2021 that Taiwan ‚Äúis independent‚Äù and ‚Äúmakes its own decisions,‚Äù a description that contravenes long-standing U.S. policy that does not recognize Taiwan as an independent, sovereign state. Washington‚Äôs actions and rhetoric have raised fears in Beijing. These statements do far more to undermine deterrence than they do to bolster it. Beijing has long anticipated that Washington will intervene if China tries to force unification. The Taiwan Relations Act, a law Congress passed in 1979 to define the now informal relations between Washington and Taipei after the normalization of relations between Washington and Beijing, states that ‚Äúany effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes,‚Äù would be considered a ‚Äúthreat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.‚Äù The U.S. commitment to Taiwan does not need further clarification or beefing up, and certainly no U.S. official should invoke or even suggest anything akin to a restoration of a formal alliance. Such an unqualified commitment to Taiwan could be seen on both sides of the strait as a green light for more strident pro-independence voices in Taiwan to pursue a formal separation from China. The U.S. government should provide a comprehensive and high-level statement laying out its ‚Äúone China‚Äù policy and explaining why Taiwan matters to the United States in language that is comprehensible to the American people, beyond the rote repetition of the U.S. ‚Äúone China‚Äù policy as comprising the Taiwan Relations Act; the three U.S.-China joint communiques in 1972, 1979, and 1982; and the Six Assurances that the Reagan administration gave to Taipei in 1982. A more complete statement, such as a speech by the national security adviser or the secretary of state, should restate the positions that Biden has reportedly made clear to Xi, including that the United States does not support Taiwan‚Äôs independence, opposes any unilateral change to the status quo by either side, does not pursue a ‚Äútwo Chinas‚Äù or ‚Äúone China, one Taiwan‚Äù policy, and does not seek to use Taiwan as part of a strategy to contain China or embolden Taipei to push for independence. Such a statement should include the assurance provided by prior administrations that the United States will accept any outcome reached peacefully by both sides and that has the assent of the people of Taiwan. Until recently, no Biden administration official had publicly called for the resumption of cross-strait dialogue to reduce misunderstandings and manage problems, a position that was central to U.S. policy before the Trump administration. It is welcome that American Institute in Taiwan Chair Laura Rosenberger, in a roundtable with the media in Taipei in October 2023, said that the United States supports cross-strait dialogue and called on Beijing to start a dialogue with Taiwan. Even though Beijing is responsible for the breakdown of cross-strait dialogue, the failure of the United States to encourage a return to talks has been interpreted by Beijing as further evidence that Washington does not want the two sides of the strait to settle their disputes. If Beijing believes that Washington does not truly want cross-strait tensions to be resolved, it will be much harder for the United States to deter an attack on Taiwan. U.S. officials should also work to ensure that Taiwan does not upset the status quo. Taiwan has laudably begun to strengthen its defenses under Tsai, but her administration has also tactfully refrained from pushing pro-independence initiatives. That marks a departure from her DPP predecessor as president, Chen Shui-bian, who held a referendum in 2008 on pursuing membership in the United Nations under the name Taiwan, rather than the Republic of China, which was rightly interpreted by both Beijing and Washington as a ploy to promote independence. Since the UN is an international institution for which statehood is a requirement for membership, to apply under the name Taiwan instead of the Republic of China would assert the full sovereign separation of the island. If a future government of Taiwan or key political figures appear to be promoting such a change in the status quo, U.S. officials should voice concerns in private, in public, or both. The United States should never coordinate its Taiwan policy with Beijing, but if a rebuke to Taiwan about unilateral efforts to assert independence is delivered only privately, Washington should inform Beijing of that admonition through diplomatic channels so that American assurances remain credible. Taiwanese troops in Taichung, Taiwan, November 2023 The United States could be more transparent about the parameters of its ‚Äúunofficial relationship‚Äù with Taipei, including self-imposed limits on visits to Taiwan by the U.S. president, vice president, secretary of state, and secretary of defense. Taiwan‚Äôs president and vice president have long been permitted to make transit visits through the United States en route to other countries, but they do not visit Washington. Such transits are private, unofficial, and arranged for the ‚Äúsafety, comfort, convenience, and dignity of the traveler,‚Äù according to the U.S. State Department. As such, these transits should not be occasions for large-scale, public, politically charged events. Following this precedent and acting consistently will make more believable the U.S. position that the United States is not treating Taiwan as it would a sovereign, independent state. U.S. officials, including members of Congress, should refrain from making statements that are inconsistent with the Taiwan Relations Act. Resolutions calling for the United States to recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state or provide an unconditional defense commitment ironically weaken deterrence by suggesting Washington intends to restore the alliance with Taipei that it abrogated in 1979. Legislation should focus on helping Taiwan defend itself and on bolstering U.S. military capabilities in East Asia in ways that are consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, while avoiding symbolic actions that do nothing to strengthen Taiwan or U.S. forces but could undermine the credibility of U.S. assurances to China. Just as the executive branch does not send the holders of the top four positions in the U.S. government to Taiwan, similarly, as a matter of policy, Congress should not send to Taiwan the president of the Senate (who is also the vice president of the United States), the Senate president pro tempore, or the Speaker of the House. There are sufficient informal channels for these officials to give and receive messages from Taiwan and to support Taiwan without providing a convenient occasion for Beijing to ratchet up military pressure while blaming Washington and Taipei for sparking tensions. Such expressions of U.S. support for Taiwan are counterproductive as they only make the island less secure. TRUE DETERRENCESome policymakers and analysts make the mistake of conflating assurances with appeasement or outright capitulation. This is wrong-headed. Alongside credible threats, credible assurances are an integral part of deterrence. Given the dramatic ongoing modernization of the Chinese military and China‚Äôs increasing assertiveness, the United States needs to strengthen its military posture in East Asia and assist in improving Taiwan‚Äôs defensive capabilities and helping the island withstand a potential blockade. The United States will need cooperation from regional allies to make necessary adjustments in its military posture. But failure to provide assurances to Beijing about the purpose of such adjustments will reduce the likelihood of allied cooperation‚Äîand make China harder to deter. Many might argue that assurances would signal weakness and invite Chinese aggression. On the contrary, these assurances would help strengthen a deterrence strategy that includes reinforcing the U.S. military presence in East Asia and hardening Taiwan‚Äôs defense. It is precisely because tough measures are needed that it is imperative that Washington and Taipei accompany them with productive diplomatic ones, assuring Beijing that it will not be punished if it forgoes the use of force.","link":"/taiwan-and-the-true-sources-of-deterrence/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Jewish","slug":"Jewish","link":"/tags/Jewish/"},{"name":"Palestine-Israel Conflict","slug":"Palestine-Israel-Conflict","link":"/tags/Palestine-Israel-Conflict/"},{"name":"Great-Power Game","slug":"Great-Power-Game","link":"/tags/Great-Power-Game/"},{"name":"China-U.S. relations","slug":"China-U-S-relations","link":"/tags/China-U-S-relations/"},{"name":"the Taiwan Strait","slug":"the-Taiwan-Strait","link":"/tags/the-Taiwan-Strait/"}],"categories":[]}
